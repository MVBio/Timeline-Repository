      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">My first memory is getting Pablo. He’s a stuffed penguin from 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u><i>the Backyardigans</i></u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0vO0tvn.jpg" width="800" height="450" />

 a TV show I loved as a kid. I was 2 years old at this point, and we were in America for a short period of time. (But we were living in Qinhuangdao.) Apparently, my mom and dad had left my last stuffed animal (a gorilla) behind. We were on some
        long car ride at the time, and when my parents realized they panicked and quickly drove to a nearby store to get another one. I remember choosing between him and a Curious George stuffed animal, and that I chose Pablo because he had more soft
        parts, as opposed to stiff velvety parts. Pablo has always held temperatures and smells really well, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I've slept with him as long as I can remember</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AGqUpqv.jpg" width="534" height="800" />

        I still do. When I was in Fuzhou, I tried to get out of punishments with him. My parents would ask, "what do you think is an appropriate consequence for what you did?" And I would say, "make me not sleep with Pablo," and I would act really
        sad. Although I didn't like sleeping without him, I used it to get out of even worse punishments, like spankings. Another early memory was going on an elephant ride with my family in Thailand. Kesed was constantly crying, so I think he and my
        mom stayed behind while the rest of us

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>rode the elephants</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/86iULTo.jpg" width="750" height="500" />

        Charis might have stayed with her because she was afraid of the elephants, I'm not sure. The smell of elephants is super distinctive, and I’ve smelled it a ton since I’ve gone to lots of elephant places in Thailand before, but it's always
        funny to smell something and say out loud “that smells like elephants.” I guess not many people expect me to know what that smells like. I learned how to read when I was 2, and around the same time I stopped taking naps. One more memory I
        have that isn't attached to a Chinese city in particular was on one of our trips to Thailand. We were at the zoo with the Masseys, super close family friends of ours who lived in China all up until 2015. Now as far back as I can remember of
        this time, me and their youngest daughter, Anna, had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>kind of a thing for each other</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HOzULGm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        At one point during the visit to the zoo, I must have done something wrong, and she stormed off. I panicked and chased after her, begging her to 'be my girlfriend' again. This is when I was about 6 by the way. I had already known her for a long time, though, maybe since age
        2? Anyway, she was the main girl I thought about from the age of 3 to about 9. Until the early Fuzhou years, our family used

 EVERYWHERE. Before this, when it was basically just Selah and I, we had a single one, but once the other kids started rolling around we upgraded to the double, and that's the one I remember more. Also: our family has a lot of traditions. I mention a bunch of them throughout this biography, but there are a couple that aren't linked to any events in
        particular. Every night, as we are giving hugs and kisses goodnight, my parents (usually my dad) asks the boys, "What are you gonna be when you grow up?" and we respond "A good husband, a good dad, to the glory of God." He asks the girls "Who
        are you gonna marry?" and they say "A boy that loves Jesus, has a job, and you have to like him." We also do devos (devotionals) every morning after breakfast, or in recent years after breakfast on school mornings. We do things like go
        through a book, focus on a theme, and that's what gives us our general topic. We all get out our Bibles and read our parts, and then our dad (or, more recently, my mom) will guide us through the discussion. In this way, I've always been much more

 I was to be baptized in 2010.) Throughout our many trips to Thailand, one thing we did several times was go to these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>fish spas</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/F7USN97.jpg" width="599.025" height="802" />

        We would put our feet/hands/entire body in these tanks with tiny fish, and those fish would nibble away at our dead skin. It was super ticklish, and from then on every time I was in Thailand and I saw a public fishbowl thing I would stick my
        hand in to see if it was the nibbley ones. Speaking of Thailand, for a longggg time, 13 years at least, my favorite color was yellow. I would always tell people about how the king of Thailand's favorite color was also yellow, which was true.
        In Thailand, at least while that king was on the throne, yellow was a special color. Obviously, he wore it in all 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>his pictures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/979s4eS.jpg" width="570" height="720" />

        There might even have been restrictions on wearing yellow clothes, or maybe I'm thinking about how everyone is supposed to wear yellow on the king's birthday. Either way, I loved the color yellow for a long time. It's why I always loved the
        yellow

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>2008 Beijing Olympics mascot</u>/doll</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8xUKw3u.jpg" width="1200" height="397" />

        the most. I say doll because at one point someone gave us a box of all 5 in doll form, which us kids divided amongst us. I got yellow, Selah got blue (always her favorite color), Kesed got red (his favorite color for a long time, eventually
        going back and forth with green), Charis got green, and Makaria got black. Since 2016 or 2017 (age 12 or 13), my favorite color has been orange, not bright orange but

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sunset orange</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/TRhtidR.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        though in the last few months yellow has started to close the gap again. <button onclick="var milk = 1; timechungus();" style="background-color: red;">

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">I don’t remember a ton about Qinhuangdao. 80 days after we moved there, we flew back to Boston so my mom could give birth to Charis. My dad was studying at Gordon Conwell at this point. During this time,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got stitches on my chin</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fqje5hm.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        for <i>pretending to sleep-RUN</I> and hitting my chin on the concrete steps leading into our apartment. The second thing I remember is this time when I got stung by a wasp. The way I remember it, I went over this hill, maybe to get a ball
        that had rolled off or something. I then stopped and saw an old car that was basically a giant wasp's nest. Next thing I knew, I was being stung left and right as I ran back to the rest of the group. My parents told me it was a small nest in
        the seat of an abandoned car and that I was only stung by one of them. I think it was in

        Selah had one birthday during this time in America, and at the party she had

        I have this isolated memory of when I was playing Cars with

        I think we were in America at the time, and

        I think they were British? Anyway, he used the green Chick one to smash into my McQueen one, and I remember saying "No, Chick. That's mean." For some reason I also remember that the blue Dinaco one had a dented spoiler that leant to the
        right. During this trip to America, the only other memory I have that's not been mentioned is one of

        "would you rather have heaven without Jesus or Jesus without heaven?" and she answered "Jesus without heaven." Then she got baptized. Whenever we needed to clean up our stuff, my mom and dad would play "Jai Ho"

        this pink plastic duck that we used for potty-training. (I'm pretty sure all of us except for Makaria went through our potty-training phase in Qinhuangdao. When my parents first told me I would be sharing a bed with Kesed, I complained, saying that he always peed the bed. After Qinhuangdao, though, we would get our bunk beds, the ones that we would use all the way up until the move to America 9 years later.) The only toys I remember playing with

        <span> <u>were these wooden train tracks and trains from Thomas the Tank Engine</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QcKLCeJ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I can remember the basic layout of our apartment complex, but that’s about it. Apparently there was one of those static fountain areas nearby, and at one point I pushed a girl into it even though it was dry. I remember we had one friend, a
        Chinese girl around Selah’s age, but that was about it. My parents had a bunch of adult Chinese friends, though.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We went to one of their weddings</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XWRMOkY.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        <span> <u>I was assigned to be the ring bearer</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PwjGJYp.jpg" />

        I was super excited that I was chosen to be this "ring bear," though I wasn't sure how I would act my part. At the wedding,

        for some reason I remember drinking something yellow with my dad. (And I can't believe

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>there's a picture of this one</u>.)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4vnnq3u.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I'm not sure where we met her, but one of the first concrete times I remember seeing her is

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>in this group of volunteers</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/A0wpsEZ.jpg" width="704" height="468" />

        the earliest such group that I remember. I still recognize a lot of their faces. I remember that during our time with this team, we dubbed ourselves "the water team." One of the locations I link with this time period was a coffee shop we went
        to often. It had tons of books and was very brown. There was a song that always played over the speakers, "Ya Birthday". I only recently heard it again.

        (All I knew to type into Google was the only line I remembered: "it's mine, it's yours, it's everybody's birthday." We called that the birthday song for a while. Two things that are always linked to that time period were these pens that had these
        Bible tracts that rolled out of the sides, as well as this coffeecake my mom always made. I remember jabbering on about water on the way to the train station, and how that was one of the first times I was sad about someone leaving. One night around this time, I woke up covered from head to toe in mosquito bites. I went to my parents’ room and knocked on their door, and
        when they saw me they at first thought I had chicken pox! The next day they tried to hunt down the mosquitoes, but they couldn’t find very many. Eventually, DaYu found and killed one mosquito that was triple the size of a normal mosquito.
        After that, I didn’t have any major issues with mosquito bites. I remember one time where apparently some people came and handed us some pamphlets. My parents explained to us that they were from a cult, but at the time I thought they had said
        colt, like a donkey. I guess I had recently learned about the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a colt around that time. I had these

        <a id="2008link">Qinhuangdao</a> was near the place where the Great Wall meets the ocean, so

        we went to both pretty often.

        At one point, I went through a phase where I was super polite to girls, saying “ladies first” everywhere.

 not in a specific styles or using precise moves, but just the way I felt like it. This attitude remains with me to this day. In all of my high school events involving free dancing, I always went all in, something that always got a lot of attention, since many at my school were too timid to do much more than stand to the side. My parents told me this next story. One time, I took a liking to the phrase “you want a piece of me.” Maybe I heard it from a TV show or
        something. Anyway, I asked DaYu how to say that in Chinese. She gave me the literal translation, “你要我的一块么?" (literally, "Do you want a piece of me?” The next time we went to this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>hot pot place</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/clpVgEY.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        (which I think had trains going around the restaurant with plates of food on top), I asked the waitress “you wanna piece of me?” in Chinese. I must not have worded it right, but the exact way I said it actually meant “you wanna hook up?” in
        Chinese. Keep in mind this is when I was 5 or 6. Apparently the waitress’s face turned really pale, and DaYu had to explain to her what I actually meant. Another hot pot-type restaurant place we went to a few times had the stereotypical
        Chinese animal-organ dishes. I had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>chicken hearts</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vmV5Sbu.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

        as well as pieces of cow/pig organs. One thing I remember about Qinhuangdao was that we planted cucumber seeds in the ground right in front of our apartment. I’ve wondered if those have grown every once in a while. At 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>my youeryuan</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SEgBscj.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I did a couple of things that stick out in my memory. The first is that every time my class would go out in the morning for the morning dance (I remember that one song was about "the genie and the lamp,) I would go and hide in the little
        plastic house that was on the playground. I did this for a super long time, until eventually they told me I had to get out and participate. I would always peek out at them from inside the musky plastic play house, feeling super stealthy. The
        second thing I remember doing at that school was singing Happy Birthday in English for my entire kindergarten. I remember being really nervous, but I went on stage and sang my heart out.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I had many performances where I wore makeup</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v1PNPfu.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        including one where I was dressed in what was essentially a plastic bag, equipped with a plastic bowl and a shower cap. Needless to say

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was not pleased</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/D95FQkE.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        When we had to wash our hands before and after meals / using the bathroom, I would soap up my hands, squeeze them together, open them while keeping my fingertips attached, then try to blow bubbles out of each of the finger holes. Across the
        street from the youeryuan, at least in my memory, was our house church. There was one girl there that was named 

        <span onmouseover="ontext51();"><u>Hannah</u>.</span>

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV51" width="600" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo51()" onload="offvideo51()" onmouseout="offvideo51()" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ix0Et1rZzkt0rdMuyVD_v4VlBkr9E1a0/preview"></iframe>

 I think she was a bit older than me. The only reason I remember her is because I was fascinated by how you can spell
        Hannah forwards and backwards. One thing that always associates itself with Hannah and my youeryuan is this toy we had. It was shaped like a clock, and it had a nose that you could press in the middle. It could also play a few songs, like Ba
        ba black sheep and pop goes the weasel (which I remember especially clearly). I can remember watching a few TV shows/movies in the early days. 

Veggietales,

 Dora, Little Einsteins, Baby Einstein / Blue's Clues (a LOT earlier), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (Saturday mornings on my
        grandparents' bed in America), Hermie and Friends, and Jay-Jay the Jet Plane were the main TV shows. Kung Fu Panda, Rocket Man, Flushed Away, the Curious George Movie, Nemo, the Incredibles, and Cars were the movies that were put on loop. One
        of the only landmarks I remember from Jinan is

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this old German church</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HB6inGJ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We never went there, and I'm not even sure we went inside, but it was cool nonetheless. Around the same time, as we did the usual explore-the-new-city routine, we had this game where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we tried to find letters of the alphabet around us</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jqDck3q.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        In Jinan, we occasionally went to Pizza Hut, which was the height of a special treat<a id="2009.tag">.</a>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">In both Qinhuangdao and Jinan,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>there were these candles we would buy for our birthdays</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/xJW775k.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        They were pink and flower-shaped, and they had this tiny high pitched speaker in the center that would play the birthday song on loop. Every time, it would be a new experiment on how to turn it off. There was no one/off switch. It just
        started playing once you lit the middle section and the whole thing opened up. We tried burning it, smashing it with a hammer, freezing it, dropping it from the top of a building, and letting it sit outside for several days. None of it
        worked, and we always had to just throw it away while it was still playing the song. Eventually, we did figure out how to turn it off. We had to dissect it and cut a certain wire far inside. Sometime while we were living in Qinhuangdao, me
        and Selah were playing the keep-the-balloon-off-the-floor game. Suddenly, Selah hits it towards the big potted plant we had nearby. As it approached the floor, I knew I had to stop it at all costs. So I dived forward... and gashed the side of
        my eye. Yeah,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I had to get stitches for that one</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W86crVf.jpg" />

        On both my chin stitches and my eye stitches, I wasn't given anesthesia/numbing medicine. I'm not sure why for the first one (and my family says they actually did), but it was too close to my eye for the second one for sure. My dad had to
        hold me down.

        Qinhuangdao was also where we got Makaria. My parents went to Ethiopia for about two weeks, and during this time Dayu stayed in our house and took care of us. The plan was for my parents to come back with Makaria, and then we would move to
        Jinan a few days later. Her visa had some issues, though, so they were delayed. My dad came back by himself to move us kids and all our stuff to Jinan, taking a train ride with 4 kids aged 2-8 across the country, in addition to all the stuff
        we owned. My mom later came with Makaria to meet us in Jinan. The morning after she got back,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I woke up to a sleeping Makaria in my parents’ room</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XrtyzCw.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

        Before we saw her, my parents established that we wouldn't be making comments about her skin color or anything else like that. I remember agreeing with them, explaining to the other kids not to make offhanded comments like "take a bath"
        or "you have mud on you." Looking back, it sounds really bad, but keep in mind that this was the first time I had actually interacted with (or really seen at all) a black person, because China has very few of them in general, not to mention
        that Qinhuangdao was the most rural of all the cities I would live in (Donkey carts were still commonly used for transportation, if that gives any reference) and thus had a less diverse population than the rest of China. My parents brought
        back a few other things they bought in the markets in Ethiopia. They got these dolls for the girls, drums for the boys (mine's bigger and makes a deeper sound), and a painting of a shepherd boy holding a lamb. Soon after we adopted her, we realized she was getting sick way too often. We ended up finding out she was allergic to dairy, and that was what was causing all the problems. (Years later, we would find out that she was also allergic to eggs and shellfish.)

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">We were only in Jinan for about a year, but I remember a decent amount about it. Driving into Jinan, I remember seeing lots of cranes and construction sites in general. Before we had an official apartment, I think

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we stayed with the Morellos</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHGMnJX.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        or at least went over to their house a lot. I remember going into the boys’ room and playing with some

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>glowy peg board things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dgTFYc1.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        The only neighbors we knew were this black mom and her daughter, whose name was Livi.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We went to her birthday party</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/riaA70E.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        once. All I remember of that was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>some cringey dancing to fast music on my part</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0D0JUp1.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        One thing I definitely remember from Jinan was always trying to sneak

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sugar chunk things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQUiBQn.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        into our shopping cart. Me and Charis (Selah claims this was her, not Charis) would go along with our Ayi and try to put the sugar crystals at the very front of the grocery pile so the cashier person would scan them before our Ayi had a
        chance to take them off. I think our apartment complex was raised up, and escalators took us down to the normal ground level. Below the main escalator was a Walmart. I remember how

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the sky was gray almost every day of the year</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HPbuEb9.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        but my parents said it was fake snow. I think at the time I thought they meant that it wasn’t actually snow but finely shredded paper or something. We did make an igloo out of it once in

 The two movies I remember seeing in theaters in Jinan was Up and Toy Story 3. I remember being really scared by the incinerator scene in the second one. A bit
        after this, a couple was at our house talking to my mom and dad. For some reason, my parents let us kids make some bread for them to try. We had never done this kind of thing before, and we weren't following a recipe either. We basically just
        threw things together as we saw fit. When it came out of the oven, I remember it being being really dry and not good to eat. My parents acted nice about it though, and my mom explained to us that we had put too many eggs in. At the time, I
        remember looking back to when I was sitting on the counter, cracking egg after egg into the mixing bowl. I felt bad. In December 2009, 

 where we visited

        (We went to this place twice, as I recall.) I just remember

        <a id="2010.tag">My</a>
        school in Jinan only had two classes, Chinese and Math, or at least that’s all I took each day. In every city up to Qingdao, I would attend Chinese school in the morning and homeschool in the afternoon. Everyone getting out their sleeping
        mats to take their midday nap was my cue to look for my parents coming to pick me up near the doors. (At home, and often still to this day, we have "rest time", anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour of no talking and mandatory silent
        reading/napping/working time.) On the way back from school each day, we would pass by the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>butcher’s shop</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WWMlHD2.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        across the road, and my dad was the cool one who would stop and let us kids look at it for a bit. Now that I think of it, it was kind of gory, and the goats made really pathetic noises all the time, but I was fascinated. They would slit the
        goat’s throat and lay it out alongside the road so the blood would drain into the gutters. I would hear the bleating from inside my classroom every day. In school itself, I remember the math teacher being younger and prettier than the Chinese
        one. We used actual abacuses in math, which I found really cool. I remember I loved the math class and was usually bored in Chinese. I got in trouble a lot more in Chinese. For some reason, I was always proud and happy when I got sent over
        into the next classroom as a punishment. I would sit in the back of the adjoining classroom and wave at the other kids with a big smile on my face. I remember a few things about the food there. One, every once in a while they would have these
        buns with a sugary paste thing inside, and that was always my favorite. Another time, I gnawed on a bone until I got to the middle, in which I found things that looked like tiny bits of spinach or some other dark green vegetable. I also
        remember that they would have these quail eggs every so often, and I loved those because they were just like chicken eggs, but you could eat them all in one bite. One time, I think in Jinan, our landlord,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>whose daughter was friends with Selah</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rC4Bea0.jpg" width="500" height="360" />


        <span> <u>invited us into the mountains to pick these purple weed things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DNMe27E.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and have a meal with him and some other families. I specifically remember that this was the first time I realized that I didn’t like eating fish. Selah, on the other hand, ate the eyeballs. An odd thing I remember is that I was really good at
        sudokus during this time. I had this small yellow book full of them and I would always show guests how fast I could do them. I think I heard my parents remark on how fast I was a couple of times to guests and other friends. I also decided to try and memorize the entirety of 

        <span>"<u>Brown bear, Brown bear, what do you see?</u>"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kL9ETli.jpg" width="571.429" height="800"/>

, which was apparently pretty impressive for my age, judging from everyone's incredulous reactions when I rattled it off for them. It wasn't very long, I just don't think many other 6-year-olds were trying to memorize their favorite book by heart just for fun.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We had this moat that went around our central complex area</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/a0VwVLf.jpg" width="500" height="360" />

        It had several wooden bridges that went over, and it had tadpoles that swam in the water. It wasn’t very deep, but for some reason

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I loved to swim around in it</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N1qJwdU.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I would especially like when all the grandmas would come out and scold me, saying I would get a cold. I’m not sure why I liked it, I just remember that it was funny when they all gathered around in a noisy bunch to tell me off. Me and Selah
        would often get small plastic bags to catch the tadpoles, but then we would always release them. I remember that one day in Jinan I took a nap as my mom worked at the sewing machine. This was the only nap I would take from the age of 2 to the
        age of 14. During the 5 years we spent in Jinan, we watched the first viral video of our family,

        <span onmouseover="ontext26();"><u>Charlie bit me</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV26" width="600" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo26()" onload="offvideo26()" onmouseout="offvideo26()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T3sJk47tKsfVidSP24S1Uzf9cZN9DuPY" controls></video>

        (This would be the first of many such videos, as you'll see later on)

        I think it was in Jinan and the start of Fuzhou that me and Charis began taking Taekwondo classes. As to the class itself, I just remember doing tons of exercises (like pushups) and the final belt test. Each student went into a room and stood
        in front of our instructors while we showcased our Taekwondo routine. After a few weeks, they were supposed to send us our yellow belts if we passed, but we moved cities before that happened, so we never got those yellow belts. Something I
        remember that relates to Taekwondo is when my parents gave me motivation to get stronger. I was really bad at pushups, but they told me I could have 100 (?) kuai if I could do 40 sit-ups in a row. I practiced and practiced, and when I finally
        accomplished the feat I felt so proud of myself.


        One Christmas (or some other special occasion), my parents (my dad specifically asked me, I think) asked me if I wanted one big gift or a bunch of small gifts. I thought about it for a while, and I eventually decided I wanted one big gift.
        They then gave me a baseball glove, which they had been saving for a time like this. I was super excited. I went out and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>played catch</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qYNs2vm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        with my dad a bunch of times after that. One thing my dad started in Jinan that he continued all up until we left China was our hangouts (we called them dates -

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>here's Kesed on one of them</u>)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QheBCrl.jpg" width="600" height="448.6" />

        Since my mom got to see us a lot more (being a stay-at-home mom), my dad started taking each of us kids out once a week on a rotating basis. We would go to some restaurant (often McDonalds), have breakfast, chat, talk about life or any
        situations that were happening in our lives, and usually play some kind of game. At the beginning, these games were physical ones, such as Chinese chess,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Gobblet</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/p7kNCQf.jpg" width="500" height="500" />

        or 五子棋 (gomoku). In later years, like the end of Fuzhou and most of Qingdao, games were mainly played on his iPad, games like Ticket to Ride or Catan. It really did bring him and us kids closer, because it gave us long one-on-one time that we
        could look forward to.


        Either the transition to or from Jinan was really chaotic, and it was one where a bunch of kids were on an overnight train with one of the parents. (I think my dad.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Our family and DaYu were really close</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zoGNtTk.jpg" width="450" height=600"" />


        and she moved with us from Qinhuangdao to Jinan, and would soon move again with us from Jinan to Fuzhou.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I'm pretty sure Jinan was where my grandparents came on one of their trips to visit</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/tHQnrY7.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        One of the things we did with them was go to this park that had a pigeon-feeding area. I remember Charis was always afraid of them, and that I was at first, but soon

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was easily feeding them</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/87AJW8d.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        out of those small ziplock bags of corn the vendors there sold. Mimi (my mom's mom) brought along this big black bag full of pieces of a

        <span>"<u>marble tower</u>,"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dawWJtF.jpg" width="400" height="650" />

        something we would go on to play with a ton. Now, as far back as I can remember, my family had gone to conferences in Thailand for two things: there were homeschool conferences, where we would take standardized tests to make sure we were
        keeping up with academic standards, and AGMs, which were company meetings where the adults talked about boring adult stuff and the kids would do fun activities, with more and more bible stuff mixed in as we got older and older. At the first
        one I have a specific memory of, we were at the Lotus hotel. It was morning and my family was having breakfast. As we sat down to eat (and I had a big helping of pineapple, which I always ate at these conferences) I asked my dad if egg yolks
        were healthy or not. At the time, I heard him say that egg yolks were made of straw, as in hay. I was taken aback, and it wasn’t until many years later that I realized that he had most likely said that egg yolks had a lot of cholesterol, and
        that I had misheard him. Another thing that I did for a REALLY long time at these conferences was make "cheese juice." This was a 50/50 mixture of orange juice and milk. (It was called cheese juice because of its color) It wasn't too bad, but
        the reactions it got made it even better. During the one year we lived in Jinan,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got baptized</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5ZHWtTi.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We all went to someone's house, and 

        <span onmouseover="ontext38()"><u>I was baptized</u></span>

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV38" width="640" height="480" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo38()" onload="offvideo38()" onmouseout="offvideo38()" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbAe-DpA_6Ts-mafoZv7b3LstppJESIM/preview"></iframe>

along with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Emma Corollo</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnvUyAA.jpg" />

        and Clara Wind.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>There was cake there as well</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3XP5ycq.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and it was this big party. Which reminds me. One random day in Jinan, I was doing something in the dirt, playing with dirt or something. A couple walked by at one point and stopped to see what I was doing. This was very normal, and I didn't
        react. After a bit, they asked if I was afraid of the ants. Now, for some reason, in an inspired response I talked to them about how because of Jesus I didn't have to be afraid of the ants. Now that I think of it, I might have been playing
        with an anthill itself. Anyway, they listened for a bit, nodding and such. As I finished up, I saw an ant or two on my arm. I jerked my arm back and brushed them off. The Ayi then said "I thought you said Jesus let you not be afraid of ants."
        I realized my mistake and said "Oh yeah. I'm not actually scared. I was just testing you." or something like that. The only Father's Day we had in Jinan, my parents were trying to get a good picture of all us kids together. The problem was,
        there was always one of us that wasn't smiling, and the rest of us were forcing it. Eventually, my dad turned to my mom and said "get ready to take a bunch of pictures." My mom didn't know what he was gonna do, but just nodded. He then moved
        behind her and... mooned us.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>That led to this picture right here</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q9axZdO.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">In early July 2010,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went on what would be our longest stateside</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kJzzrX8.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        a grand total of 8 months. It was prolonged because Makaria was having various medical/visa issues. A week and a half after

 to America,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went on a trip to Washington D.C. with my grandparents</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lP3LMf8.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We stayed

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>in this red house</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/76C9Zbz.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We visited the Lincoln museum, the White House, the Washington memorial,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>some memorial with black walls</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jaQ4TDc.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

         [Vietnam Veterans Museum], and the Lincoln memorial, which I remember as being a SUPER long walk. I had to push the stroller with the two youngest for most of the time. We also visited several of the Smithsonian museums. The only part of that I remember is

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>holding this big beetle thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PM5iifP.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and getting two of these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dinosaur toys</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/h92NP6R.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        near the exit. It was one of those things where you squeeze the handle to make the top close, something I had always wanted. Eventually there would be some drama over them. I think one of us accidentally broke one of them and
        fought over whose the second one was.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We also saw the hope diamond, so that was pretty cool</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ydjcau6.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        After much asking, my parents bought me a "I ♡ DC" shirt, because I had always seen the New York equivalent in movies. We went to Mount Vernon, where I remember looking over the river to Maryland, waiting in a long line, then

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>getting my picture taken with some Chinese tourists</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/V1rlyNR.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Lastly, we went to a Holocaust museum,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>where we met a survivor</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Tk8FQsk.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Bask at Mimi and Grampa's house, we swam a ton. This was the first stateside I had gone on where I knew how to swim all on my own, (since I had been learning the last time) so

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was super excited</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/56B0an2.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Something I definitely remember that might have been on this stateside (or the next one) was coming up for air one time only to get trapped under this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>big blue floatie thing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/680ycz1.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I remember whipping my head left and right, panicking as I looked for the nearest edge. That was one of the first times I remember thinking that drowning would be one of the worst ways to die. We kids

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>always used to hang onto Uncle Mike in the pool</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r3xE5sW.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        He was funny and really good with us kids. Another feature of the pool was that it had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>colored lights that would turn on</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QQq00eY.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        in the rare occasion we were allowed to swim that late. As happened every time we went to the States, we had a big reunion with extended family. I remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sitting on the couch with a whole bunch of little kids while we took a picture</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j6u71sB.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Dayu actually came with us to the states that time, which was super cool. She was the one that helped a bunch of us kids learn to swim. I'm pretty sure she herself learned to swim at one of the earlier statesides. There was this one
        restaurant we went to a lot, at least during the early stateside. It was Brooklyn Bagel. I always loved the strawberry and blueberry ones the best. To the side of the main ordering area was a kids place where I would always read this tattered
        book, maybe the Fire Cat? Something like that. Another one of the big places we visited was A&M. I think this was the first time most of us kids had been there.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Mimi and Dayu went with us</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jenaSJB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We did a general tour of the campus, and we also went to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the church where my mom and dad met</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QSE7uAS.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        This stateside was the first one that I clearly remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>being in the kids thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XT2Ka0z.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        in the church we went to, Crossroads. They had these sticker name tags that I found fascinating. Back at the house, this was the stateside

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I learned how to ride a bike</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DEaICNg.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        There is one place that I have random flashbacks to every now and then. It was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>science museum</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/U7zd6il.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        somewhere in America. I loved it. There was some kind of vacuum-powered ping pong ball delivery system that I did with Dayu a ton as well as a super cool water area. I guess I should talk about my grandparents' house, as it was where we
        stayed every single stateside. It has two floors, a decently large front yard and a huge backyard. In the back, they have

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a spa</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q3lNbKt.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and a swimming pool. Actually heat up the spa, however, has always been a rarer thing because it takes time and energy to prep it. They have a cool pantry with this light that turns off when you close the door. I loved that as a kid. There's
        the wet room to the back right of the main door, which connects to the garden area outside and Grampa's workshop. We were never allowed to just wander around in there, because there were tons of dangerous tools. On this stateside, me and Charis (and maybe Selah) made our boxes with Grampa. And I mean <i>made them</i>, too. We helped him a bit to cut and sand the wood, as well as some of the painting. (All with his supervision, of course.) They were/are made out of wood, and we each chose the colors they were painted with. They had a small clock in the lid, and they included latches with combination locks on the front. The clocks fell out after a year or so, but the combination locks stuck around. I remember how we would find one after forgetting the combination, and I would use it to fiddle by trying every single code until my hands smelled super strongly of metal. At least once, I could have sworn I had tried every single combination without it opening. But yeah. I think I've always used it as a memory box, used in conjunction with my official memory box compiled by my parents. I've made sure to grab souvenirs from almost every major trip / vacation / stateside since, all so I can put it into my now-overflowing box.



 In the garden I mentioned earlier, I
        always used to catch these green and brown anole lizards. That was the place where my lizard-catching habit got started. Early on, they used to bring one or two of the older kids along to drive

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the lawn mower</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1CtG2VU.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I think it was only me, Selah, and Aiden that were able to drive it. Upstairs was where all the kids stayed. The place the boys stayed, the playroom (later called the Lounge), has a hidden entrance. The door is literally a fully functional
        bookshelf, so if it's closed it blends right in. There were a ton of toys in there for all but the last time I was there, including stuffed animals, this fuzzy town map carpet, Lincoln logs, and these giant colorful red top things, where you
        pressed on a thing at the top to get it spinning. There was also a small bookshelf there, by a reading area with beanbag chairs and an itchy green turf-like carpet thing. The books I loved to read the most were the Chick-fil-A superhero cow
        books as well as the "If you teach a ___ to ____" books, also from Chick-fil-A. Anyway, one of the coolest features of the upstairs was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the movie room</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9355bCU.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        It has

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>9 reclinable couch seats</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QIU5bOl.jpg" width="800" height="600" />


        that face a huge screen on the wall. We would always get snacks from the little island area nearby and run inside to watch movies. There was also an electrical room next to the movie room that we were never allowed to go into. Right out the
        main back doors in the living room, you enter into a roofed area with a fireplace, a grill, a small refrigerator, and a bunch of small tables and couches.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>That's where we would roast marshmallows and make s'mores</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zZtrIcR.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We kids always loved

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>burning the marshmallows</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/00hexJL.jpg" width="650" height="450" />


        because it was fun to see fire and because it always got a reaction out of the adults. There was a footpath that went all the way around the backyard. We always walked it with the dog, at that time

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a golden lab named Cooper</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7xpoVyc.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Back to the memories. The next thing I remember is going to this park area with the Masseys, who had been visiting for a while now. There was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one area we wanted to go to that had a bunch of these periodic synchronized water spouts</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/c7uMyAp.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>It was super fun</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zsFwsQ1.jpg" width="725" height="525" />

        and I remember we stayed for a while. We spent a lot of the time trying to cover up the holes by

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>stepping on them</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j6Y6DC4.jpg" width="525" height="700" />


        <span> <u>holding them down with our hands</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qsl9anP.jpg" width="525" height="700" />

        or

        <span> <u>just sitting on them</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v4FWiMf.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        There were a lot of us there, so I guess we thought we could get them all. Right as we were finishing with that part, a scheduled "water show" came on. Music started playing, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we all started dancing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cWXZsem.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        Some time after that,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Masseys had to leave</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/acUAj100.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        One thing that happened this America trip was that I got diagnosed with ADHD. My dad had gotten diagnosed recently, and they wanted to see if I had it too. The doctor asked me a bunch of questions about how easily I dealt with noise, stress,
        and other people in general. I had to wait in the other room for part of the appointment. On the screen in the waiting room, there was a movie playing on one of the screens. (I later identified it as the Spiderwick Chronicles.) I remember
        watching a

        <span onmouseover="ontext2()"><u>scene</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV2" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo2()" onload="offvideo2()" onmouseout="offvideo2()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1P04fPpYuQHJuWH9PWVxPnhem8Ogb2u51" controls></video>


        where a man sacrifices himself for his daughter, invisible creatures dragging him of his yard by his feet and flower petals kidnapping him into the sky. Apparently this is one of the creepiest parts of the whole movie, because when I saw it
        later the rest of it wasn't nearly as scary. All I know is that I was traumatized by that scene. That night I had nightmares, and went downstairs crying to my grandparents watching TV in the living room. At one point, we did go to the
        McKowns' family ranch. A bit of background. The McKowns are the aunt/uncle/cousins that we interacted the most with, BY FAR. The oldest, Aiden, is three months older than me. Then it's Pierce, who's in between Charis and Kesed. Then there's
        Grae, who's about Makaria's age. They lived in China as well for many years, and only moved back to America sometime around 2015. Anyway, their family ranch was really cool, and it had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one bull</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KFU6Qn6.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        that was supposedly very dangerous. We weren't really allowed near it. The only other thing I remember about that ranch trip was that it was in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a dry, dusty desert area</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SJMgmgM.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        that it had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>one horse that I was afraid would bite me</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wXYuDws.jpg" width="375" height="550" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="ontext4()"><u>this educational TV show thing</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV4" width="640" height="360" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo4()" onload="offvideo4()" onmouseout="offvideo4()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x1WYA1-NFVT_6lvTqg4HH13qSbbZtdy2" controls></video>

        that was on in the background one of the days. They were frog-like characters who were learning the alphabet. The main kid was in this lab where the scientist was explaining the letters and what noises they made. When the scientist asked what
        sound 'U' made, the kid said "uh...", and the scientist said "that's right!", and the kid smiled. For some reason that was really funny to me. Back in the Woodlands with my grandparents, I remember two things with the kid's program at
        Crossroads. The first was this debate with one of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the girls in the program</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwaTKDM.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I said she was African-American, and she said no, she was just American. We went back and forth for a while on that one. The second thing I remember was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>giving this presentation about China with Selah and my Dad</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/f8dYCv2.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and how we then had a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>race where we tried to pick things up with chopsticks</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8XYYIRz.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Me and Selah were the best at it, of course, so we didn't fully participate, though I wanted to so I could smash the other kids. The next thing I remember was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>visiting Aunt Jenny in the hospital</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wRY4AqB.jpg" width="800" height="600" />


        She had just had her new baby. Aunt Jenny is my dad's half sister on his mom's side. Towards the end of this thing you'll hear about my dad's full family story. Needless to say, we did not spend much time with them. In September that year, we
        went out to some country house to get family pictures taken by Aunt Kim, because she was really good at photography (My mom's younger sister and the McKowns mom.) I remember it taking forever, and how there was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cool camera thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/JjQa5Dn.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        where you looked down through the top eyehole and it would show what was in front of it. One super random thing I remember that we did from back then was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>make these houses out of snack food</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YdjGEzc.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I think it was for some sort of homeschool project, but I'm not sure. I just remembered another huge thing that happened that stateside. My grandma on my dad's side (we call her Meemaw) came and gave each of us kids

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these huge crates of toys</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6CWTcJC.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        The main toys I remember getting were these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>plastic dinosaurs</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W94An7S.jpg" width="800" height="600" />


        These toys would be almost the only toys we would have to play with for a long while. My parents were mad at her for some reason, though. I later learned it was because my parents wanted her to spend some newfound money on something wiser,
        and specifically asked her not to give us big gifts. Late that October, we did our reformation day stuff on Martin Luther. As always, we did our pin the ___ on the ____ game. This time it was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pin the 95 Theses on to the door of the Wittenberg church</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yesmhf3.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        That December, my parents went to Santa Fe to celebrate their anniversary. A few weeks later, my parents took us and our cousins to tour the Bluebell Ice Cream Factory. I don't remember much, just that

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we got some free ice cream at the end</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lckdEgn.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Oh, and I also remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>milking a metal cow</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lb1MDga.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        That Christmas, all us kids had to dress up nicely for

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>family pictures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y626UD5.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        It's the first time I remember being dressed in fancy clothes. I remember two things about that Christmas. First, I remember being fascinated with how a nutcracker doll worked. Second, I remember being paired with Uncle Mike and my dad in an
        activity where we got random props and had to come up with a Christmas skit. We got a few hats and some baby powder. The only thing I remember from

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the skit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FFqGMpR.jpg" width="800" height="600"/>

        was me trying hard not to laugh and saying "baby Jesus has diaper rash!" So that was<a id="2011.tag"> Christmas.</a>

        Somewhere around that time I got bottles of this special bubble fluid that made its bubbles sticky. That was super cool to me. Since all of us kids were in some stage of learning to ride a bike, it was not uncommon of us to go round and round
        the circular driveway, each on our own vehicle. We would most often take baths in our grandparent's room, because that was the only bath bath in the house. At that age

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we would still take them together</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0ivQWbI.jpg" width="650" height="450"/>

        and we would always put in tons of bubble bath stuff. Late January 2011, the McKowns had to leave. I was super sad. I remember how we ate Freebirds (burritos) then

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>lined up in front of a random play place to take a picture</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WAvdQYg.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Fast forward to February, when my grandparents took my parents and the three oldest kids to a horse-riding place. I was a bit nervous at first, but it became fun pretty quickly. I got

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>an old retired racing horse</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VZ7LgaP.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I kept trying to make him gallop but he wouldn't listen.

        Charis's horse was a small one

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>that was led by a guide person via a rope</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5HDmnIP.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I remember I wanted to take pictures of my horse doing its business on the road, but my mom said no. Somehow I still got one, and later made that her wallpaper as a prank. (Not included here.) February 8th,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>me and Charis celebrated our birthdays together</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3rjowtH.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        at Incredible Pizza, this place that had a ton of arcade games. My grandparents had taken me to Toys R Us so I could pick out my gift beforehand.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I chose Buzz from Toy Story</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HWLGBfc.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        Because it was our birthdays, me and Charis got to spin this wheel they had with different amount of arcade currencies as prizes. She got a small prize, but I'm pretty sure

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got one of the biggest prizes on the board</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/D6VPvgz.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        As a gift from my parents,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I finally got the hand-me-down camera I had wanted for a long time</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/H7bf26R.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        I was super excited. Later that month, the youngest three got to go to this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cowboy carnival thing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3PfD6JP.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        I was made that I didn't get to go, and I was especially mad when they came back with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all this cool stuff</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RhSLOgf.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        On March 8th, 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we finally went back to China</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ajt6Wd1.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        this time to a new city, Fuzhou.

      </p>
      <br><br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">For the first few weeks, we lived in a temporary apartment while my parents went out in search of a permanent one. We basically lived off

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>packages of bread</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yG7Wo1F.jpg" width="668.75" height="500" />

        that we bought from a local convenience store. All I remember about that apartment was that the walls were very bright, it was very small, and there was nothing in it other than a small table. We soon moved into our permanent apartment,
        though, and got all our stuff in.

        I remember how the room originally promised to the boys was given to the girls, and I was mad at first, but my parents explained that the girls needed a bigger room because they had more people. Decoration-wise, I just remember eventually there being glow in the dark stars/planets on the ceiling above my bed, and a World War 1/2 informational poster on the wall with the door. (Feeding my acute interest in those wars later on.) We brought along our old wooden brown closet, which we had had all the way since Qinhuangdao.I’m pretty sure it was soon after we moved that
        we got these mosquito net tents for ourselves, because Fuzhou was the most humid and the most mosquito-heavy city we lived in.

        <span onmouseover="ontext7()"><u>This is a tour of our house</u>,</span>
        kindly provided by Charis. She starts in the living room, then looks into the boys' room. You can see the box I made with my Grampa on the desk to the left. Then she heads into the girls' room. As she's entering, you can see the soccer balls
        in the net thingies on the floor, which I'll talk about later. I'm on the two younger girls' bed playing Cooking Mama on my iPad. She quickly glances into the doorway of my parent's room, then walks back down the hallway, passing the
        homeschool room on the right.)

        I got glasses what must have only been weeks after we returned. One system that came into place soon after moving here is the week system. Us kids would fight over everything, like who would pray at certain meals, who would press the button
        on the elevator, and anything else you can think of. So my parents came up with a system. Since we had 7 people in the family, each person was assigned a day of the week. My mom was Monday, my dad was Tuesday, and so on. I was (and am)
        Thursday. Whoever's day it was got to do all the things we used to argue about. (Or had to do whatever work no one wanted to do). We still use this system for things such as chores. Soon after we came back,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I remember doing face paint with Dayu</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HiAHme8.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I asked her to do Nemo for mine. My dad got a Chinese tutor pretty soon after moving, and he would listen to the ChinesePod Podcast. But I should go ahead and describe our apartment complex. There were tons of plants. Palm tree-ish things,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>banyan trees</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/xbH2RpN.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>patches of bamboo</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Ei3IPY.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        small ferns, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all types of flowers</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GP5s9PB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        (Including

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one type</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YQHkHrt.jpg" width="600" height="565.95" />


        where you could suck sweet stuff from the stems) made our complex feel super natural. I think there was even a pomegranate tree that we picked from every once in a while (It was rarely ripe, though.) There were also a whole bunch of peach
        trees. We almost never got them ripe, though, because the BaoAns (guards) would take them all before we got the chance. The trees would have tons of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cicadas</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rIpdHA6.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        during the summers. They were super loud, but I didn't mind that, though it was startling at times. I would always try to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>catch one</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/R7u7Pnm.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 but I became afraid to when I read that they could sometimes mistake your hand for a tree and stick their mouth straw-thing in it. (Someone had
        to show me how to catch them with my hands because of this, and I think the one in the picture is one they got for me.) The cicadas also left

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>their molted shells</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5dbdRns.jpg" width="375" height="500" />

        everywhere, which was kinda cool. Another thing about the trees - one time, I found this Swiss Army knife in a drawer that had a normal knife and a saw, among other things. The next logical course of action, of course, was to slash at the trunks of all the trees.
        They all leaked white sap, which I found super cool and interesting. Needless to say, I got into big trouble when my parents found out. Around the lowered sandbox area outside our house, there were these flowerbeds filled with small

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>purple</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/82N3Gtz.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>yellow</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RAbuSYI.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        flowers. Bees and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these small purple/blue/gray butterflies</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/aDNP72Y.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        would be on these flowers almost year-round. I tried to catch the butterflies all the time. They were easy to catch. When you did, they would sometimes leave gray/purple dust from their wings, which I thought was cool until I found out doing
        that to a butterfly can kill it. Another time, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to catch a bee using a leaf. I picked a decently thick one off a nearby bush and lay in wait. Before too long, I had caught one. I victoriously strolled up
        the ramp to our building to show my mom, when all of a sudden it stung me THROUGH the leaf. I dropped it instantly and watched as it flew away. I just remember that the sting was SUPER itchy. I went upstairs and my mom put baking soda on it.
        (After she and my siblings made fun of me for trying to catch a bee and expecting not to get stung.) Immanuel was at our house when that happened. He was there playing with Kesed upstairs when I had baking soda covering my hand.

        Our building was at the end of a long strip of buildings. We had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this giant square</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PVhNZHJ.jpg" width="700" height="700" />

        next to our house that was kind of the central playing area. When it rained a bunch,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we kids would often go outside and slide around in our bathing suits</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GyaeJ1l.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        It actually got a few inches deep before it was able to reach the drains down the main pathway. At the far corner of this square was this old gate/tower thing. We were all small enough to slip through the bars whenever we wanted to go up and
        down. We most often went down in order to go to Yonghui, the supermarket that was visible from our apartment. There was always this weird cat hanging around the bottom. It was stray, and it had one blue eye and one brown eye. It was kind of
        cool but also kind of freaked me out. A couple of meters out

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our door</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VNh9hjI.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        was

        It had two

        (in which we built a ton of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sandcastles</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cZ4jPs5.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        ) old people exercise equipment, and the usual trees/flowers. A small walk away from our apartment building was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the edge of a river</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6T7mBXV.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We never swam in it, but we did walk/bike by it a couple times. At least for the first year or two, the youngest four

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all went to the same Chinese youeryuan</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/IqNdMlO.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        in the morning. We were still homeschooling in the afternoon though. I have a couple of funny memories from the one year I was at this youeryuan. One time, a teacher cut a chunk of a girl's hair off because she had misbehaved. I took it in
        stride, but when I mentioned it to my parents they were shocked that the teacher would do that. Apparently that's not allowed in America. Another thing that happened was that my teachers kept forcing me to use my right hand. At that time,
        especially with the older teachers, left handedness was seen as some kind of disorder that needed to be fixed. When my parents found out what they were trying to do, they sternly let my teachers know to let me use whatever hand I wanted. When
        I lost a tooth, everyone said just throw it out the window, which shocked me because my parents gave us money each time we lost a tooth. (They did away with the whole tooth fairy thing.) My classmates were all obsessed with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>aotoman (Ultraman) and the monsters they fought</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VQl8n9v.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        The classroom had a bunch of these Ultraman action figures that we would all play with. I remember hearing how there had only ever been one American Ultraman, and how he had died fighting one of the monsters. I milked this as much as it was
        worth, saying that the American one was the best because he had given his life to beat the monster. I remember trying to find as many reasons to milk my American status as I could. For some reason, the kids at that age all HATED Japan. They
        would always mention how badly Japan had treated the Chinese back in World War II. This was the ONLY time I heard of Chinese people hating Japan so much. After I left Fuzhou I never really heard much about it. Maybe because I was around older
        people. Anyways, I took advantage of this to point out how Japan would never have been stopped if it hadn't been for America coming in and defeating them. And that's how I learned the Chinese word for "atomic bomb" at the tender age of 7.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">One time, my teachers all got everyone in my class

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these metal puzzle things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ij3by69.jpg" width="425" height="300" />

        No one could solve them. I got them apart using brute force, but they said that didn't count. Eventually the teachers looked it up the answer for themselves, and they were finally able to solve it. They didn't tell us the solution though. I
        think I ended up being the first person in our class to solve it, something I was super proud of. Every Monday, we would all line up outside and salute the Chinese flag as a few "special" students marched up to the flagpole carrying said flag
        and raised it to the top. every once in a while, we would get ready for these events. Typically, these were some kind of performance, gatherings, or just some program the school wanted us to go through. One I remember well is one where me and
        my classmates had to jump rope. I wanted to be the best at jumping rope. I skipped around and around the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>courtyard area</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ioHuS2T.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        Every time we were taken out to practice. I would try and see how many jumps I could do in a row without messing up. As I was more walk/skipping than jumping quickly in place, it wasn't long until I got into the thousands. I was super proud
        of myself. I remember how I wrote them all down and compared the numbers from each day with math of some sort. I was super proud of myself. There <i>were</i> a few really spoiled kids at that youeryuan. My mom had to intervene several times
        with this kid who would always hit his grandpa who came to pick him up. Also at youeryuan was this computer room where we would be allowed to go every once in a while. I always played this fish game where you start out a small fish and can
        grow bigger by eating anything smaller than you. You get bigger and bigger until you're the biggest fish. I was hooked. Eventually, on my last day there, my youeryuan teachers let me go to that room and play for about an hour before my mom
        came to get me.

        Once, my mom bought a bunch of seeds we could grow on our back porch. We were each assigned a certain type of seed. I claimed the strawberry ones first, though everyone else was kind of wanting them as well. (The other seeds were like
        tomatoes and other boring things.) Anyway, we each planted our seeds

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>in our own container</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kqWq449.jpg" width="550" height="450" />

        I must have either heard it too late or I wasn't listening at all, but I planted too many strawberry seeds and too close together. Turns out that if you do that the roots strangle each other and nothing grows. So that sucked. I realized right
        after I had planted them that I had messed up. Now here's a really random thing that I somehow remember clearly. Apparently our Uncle Casey (that's the uncle on the McKown's side) made some joke in a video about how you could hold the area
        around your belly button in a way that looks like a "hairy bagel." I kind of understood it, but not fully, and I remember thinking for way too long about why the adults found it so funny.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We kids still copied it though</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/X9ittdh.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        Alongside Dayu, we got a few more good family friends early on in Fuzhou.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Enya</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N6dcWnL.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        the Lees, the Funderburks,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Yamma</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UMbhvlc.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and to a lesser extent the Chus. I'm not sure where we met Enya, but we were friends with her all the way through our Qingdao years. She had a similar role to Dayu, just to a slightly lesser extent. The Lees were also good friends of ours.
        Mr. Gerald, the dad, was super fun. I remember he had this mark on his face from when an iron fell on him as a kid. That made me super scared of irons. Mrs. Evelyn was also fun, and she brought their kids to a bunch of our hangouts. The two
        kids,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Lani and Kina</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/o3OD7v8.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (Lani on the upper left, Kina on the middle left) were super close friends of ours. Lani mostly hung out with Selah, because they were around the same age. Kina was Charis's best friend, also because they were around the same age and loved
        doing similar things. The Lees lived in an apartment strip across the canyon area, so it wasn't too hard to get to their house. The Funderburks were made up of Mrs. Regina, Mr. Kevin, Drew, Chayli, and eventually Esther and Eden.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Drew</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vcQSSjJ.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        was about 7-8 years older than me, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chayli</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r1Ra6cc.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        was around Selah's age. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Esther</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KTSTaVE.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Eden</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BIbn3VL.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 were adopted a year or two into our time in Fuzhou. (I remember the Funderburks bringing them out from inside the van from the airport one late night.) Me and Drew would go on these hangout times, when
        we would go to mall areas, chat, maybe get some drinks, and just chill. We would talk about all sorts of things. He liked this one book series, I think <i>The Ranger's Apprentice.</i> He also liked My Little Pony, for some reason. The only
        things I remember from our hangout times was once when we discussed the difference between Pepsi and Coke and this one time where he bought me / I bought this mini pool table toy from one of the shops in the mall. Chayli was a good friend of
        ours who we hung out with a decent amount. One story, though, that stands out to me that involves her is this one time at dinner when we had her over. We were talking about school stuff, and at one point she mentioned what math level she was
        doing. (Keep in mind she's about Selah's age.) Now I was homeschooled at this point, so I had no reference up to that point where I was compared to everyone else. I knew that we might be a bit ahead, since we could go at our own pace and we
        didn't take summers off (though the frequent conferences and vacations might have made up for that.) But when she said what level she was at, I instantly felt a burst of pride. It was the first time I realized that I was ahead of everyone
        else. After hearing her response, I remember saying "Oh... I feel something a little proud coming up..." after she said that. My parents quickly rebuked me, and that was probably when it sank in to never talk about myself and my academic achievement, especially in comparison to others. (It would just made me embarrassed for them.) I don't remember a ton about the Chus. We were around them a lot less than those
        other families. I just know that we would always play Wii boxing at their house, and that I was pretty good at it.

        All of them went to our house church, at least for the first two years or so. Throughout our time in Fuzhou, also keep in mind that there were teams of volunteers coming through nonstop. We probably met 20-25 people that way. Oh, another
        thing that started in Fuzhou was my mom doing Makaria's hair. In order to have it at any decent length, my mom had to go through it with oils, lotions, and several types of combs every morning. It was and still is quite the noisy ordeal, as
        it's apparently rather painful. I should explain our visa runs for a bit. I think this is the first city we did them. From 2011 on, my family was on tourist visas. This meant that we had to leave the country every 90/60 days. (It changed a
        year or two after we moved to Qingdao.) In Fuzhou, that meant this: we would wake up at 4 AM (I remember going outside into the calm, cold night air into the pseudo-empty streets, and being reminded of the empty blinking stop sign in Cars)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>took a train</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SipdxSl.jpg" width="600.52" height="804" />

        (often a rather

 experience) to a tiny island that was part of Taiwan so technically "out of country," walking out the doors, turning around, walking straight back in, said hi to the security beagle (which I always teased Charis as
        being afraid of, since she was super afraid of dogs at this point) and returning to Fuzhou. Every 90 days. But back to the regularly scheduled programming.

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">Around this time, my mom and dad surprised us kids with a trip to Hong Kong Disney! The day before we actually went to Disney, we did a little tour of Hong Kong itself. All I remember is that late afternoon we
        went to some wax museum. That night,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went up to this high place so we could see the skyline</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FOXEfW4.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        The next day, we had breakfast at a McDonalds as we had a few times. (I had the Big Breakfast meal) Then we went to Disney.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We took the fancy Disney train there</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XrAtqHF.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        <span> <u>We took pictures with all the standard people first</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SCEBG8e.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Makaria was scared of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Jack Sparrow guy</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/M26jgZZ.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        None of us knew who he was, because we hadn't seen the Pirates of the Caribbean yet. (And we wouldn't until many years later.) I remember



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>going through the Tarzan exhibit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OPsxD44.jpg" width="450" height="650" />


        not knowing what it was, because I hadn't seen that yet either. Which reminds me, a few weeks or so before we went to Disney, some friends of ours had came and hidden these small objects (such as that battery) around the various rides and
        exhibits. We were given clues and had to find them. Anyway, next we did

        <span> <u>the teacups</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BEOoyF1.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        and

        <span> <u>the it's a small world ride</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QD8hJlt.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        At one point we found Buzz.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Kesed went up to him</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pKRHaFR.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        and said "I love you, Buzz!" and hugged his leg. Later, there was this 4D show we watched. It was something about Donald Duck and magic. At the very end, he flew towards the camera and we heard a huge crash in the back. When we looked back,
        his back half was flailing in the top of the back wall. Towards the end of the day, we got

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cotton candy with these cool light-up sticks</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ezrchtL.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        Back in Fuzhou, one of the first things that happened was one of Kesed and Makaria's school events. We all went to the carnival/festival-like thing. They had a bunch of activities there, including this shallow pool area that they had filled
        with fish. We were supposed to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>grab a plastic bag and catch them</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AXf6B81.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        which was harder than it looked. In our homeschooling, me Selah and Charis had started this astronomy course. We learned all about the planets, stars, etc, and my mom

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>made up projects for us to do</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/72YTU9L.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        to help us learn. Late June 2011, I had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>my graduation performance for youeryuan</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CuMMokP.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I remember anxiously waiting in line behind the stage, watching as the other classes went forward for

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>their performances</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B82jfpG.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (We were the highest class, so we went last.) Now, there are two big things that were only a big thing in Fuzhou: my dad's long work trips and care packages. My dad often went on long trips to teach, preach, or complete part of his PhD
        program (these were the longest, because he had to go to America.) On the especially long trips, my dad would leave us with a little booklet/list. There was one for each day he was gone, and they would sometimes have chores (everyone make
        sure you get your rooms clean, organize your closets) and would sometimes have a treat (watch a movie in the theaters, get ice cream, etc.) Every entry also had a little note from him saying how much he loved us and some words of
        encouragement. It made us feel like he was still at home, and it definitely let us know he cared about us. The second thing I attach to Fuzhou is care packages. Every so often, our grandparents, church, or volunteer groups would bring

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these huge boxes of stuff from America</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gK81p0u.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        This is where we got 99% of our fun stuff. (One thing I remember especially well was this small

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Optimus Prime</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8mh3Ibs.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        <span> <u>transforming lego set</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DpknokK.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        It was the first lego set I ever had. Before, I only had access to those giant Duplo blocks.) We kids would always wait impatiently for our parents to cut them open and see what was inside. Typically, there was stuff dedicated to each of us,
        along with some group stuff for the boys or girls. My parents were included, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>they would get things specifically for them as well</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ocP7V5z.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        There would be toys, books, games, candy, movies, cereal, or any number of other things. Many of these were especially significant because we couldn't get a lot of the candy/cereals in China. I remember how corn flakes used to be a special
        treat, and how I once ate half a bag of Twizzlers (soon after they came) while I was doing the kitchen. In Fuzhou, there were a few orphanages that we visited often. The long walk to the main one wound through a college campus, I think THE
        Fuzhou university campus. That one had regular kids. Then there was this other orphanage we went to (less often) that had kids with disabilities. I became especially good friends with one kid from each. The one from the main orphanage's name
        was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Stephen</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CkeBk78.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We hung out for about two and a half years. He would always come over to my house to hang out for the day. He was a bit rowdy, and my parents sometimes had to warn us not to hurt each other (especially in certain areas) when we would wrestle. We also did this velcro organ-body mat thing a couple times. I hung out with Stephen a bit
        more than the other kid. I don't remember his name, though I think it started with an A. He was from the disabled orphanage.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We would ride these little wheeled things around</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v3Ta6hF.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>blow bubbles</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rAPxcDc.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        which he loved popping. This orphanage was more rural and far away than the other one. I think we had to get a taxi whenever we went. We went to the regular orphanage pretty often, especially when volunteers or other guests flew in. We did
        things like fold clothes, babysit the kids, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cook food</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9xLFda.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        September 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we celebrated our first Passover</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/chWwHrO.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We kind of did this as a fun tradition, and we still do it to this day. Back then, we would all dress up, my mom would make the traditional Passover food, and we would go through all the typical Passover stuff with the difference that it had
        more of a Christian theme.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">A bit more about our larger surroundings, though. There were a few sections to our apartment complex, A-D. We were in D. Each section was a strip of apartment buildings, and we were at the very end of our strip,
        near the big empty square and the abandoned ivy-covered stairway. At the other end of our strip was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>open area</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Oi2K9DB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        with a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dried-up fountain</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vYAF6ph.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        some white tarp things, and paths leading into the road on the left. Those paths along the road is where we went to more of the farther-out places. There was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>canyon-structure</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XKYXnCj.jpg" width="802" height="599.025" />

        that ran alongside section D, with stores all along the bottom. These stores became somewhat of an interest point, as shops would open and close within months of each other. New expensive shops would open selling wine or something and within
        5 weeks would be shut down again. It became kind of an inside joke, wondering "how long is this one gonna last?" At the end of our strip past and below the empty square we always played in, the canyon joined a perpendicular canyon. Where they
        met there was the big supermarket named YongHui, where we got most of our stuff. As you entered in the front doors, you could either continue out the other side or turn to the left, where you would have the main supermarket area on your new
        left. By the doors on the other side of the main entrance, there was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bubble tea place</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/h1RiYFQ.jpg" width="600.52" height="804" />

        This was the first time I had ever heard of bubble tea. I didn't really like it, so I (and a few others) would just get lemonade drinks. We went there decently often, I think. We would send a few kids (I always remember me and Charis doing
        it.) to go and get drinks for everyone. It had a TV up on the wall that would play Mr. Bean episodes. That would sometimes cause us to stay a bit longer than we had to, because we would just stand there watching the screen. Back in the main
        store area, I remember it being semi-dimly lit. It had row after row of shopping items, with the cold areas in the back. The leftward section that you would turn into after entering YongHui had the registers taking up most of the left side,
        and closed down / small expensive stores along the right side. At the end, though, past the registers on the left, were these small shops selling cheap kids toys, goldfish in tiny containers, and other small trinkets like that. Past that,
        near the third exit, was the glasses shop. I don't think this is where we actually got any of our glasses though. Out that exit was a dark covered alleyway area that led into another building. A bit to the left and in through a pair of doors
        was a hallway that had the Dongbeicai place we always went to in and on the left. (To the right was some other random restaurant, maybe a random fast food place? There were never many people in there.) We went to the Dongbeicai place (as it
        was named) a ton. We always took volunteers and other fly-in guests there to try out some real Chinese food. It was really good. I remember how here and in previous restaurants we had to ask them to give us normal plates and silverware
        instead of the plastic-wrapped ones, because that would save 1 kuai per set. When eating here, I realized at one point that I loved the little

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>peppercorns</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MYzKYTv.jpg" width="600" height="500" />

        that were found in the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>ganbiandoujiao</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qmlOt2i.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

        I would always pick them out and eat them by the handful, much to the amusement/disgust of my family members. I don't know why, I just loved the numbing feeling. Right outside the Dongbeicai place, there was a super bright spotlight thing
        that always had dead moths on top and live moths flying around it. I'm really not sure why I remember that, but I do.

        In that general direction was our

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chinese school</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r0eKMRv.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (not the youeryuan) which we accessed through small sidewalks and pathways. Right before crossing the street to get to the school, there was a small area that held this convenience store. It was where all the students got school supplies. I loved pencil cases, especially the ones with all the little compartments and cool features such as a compass, tool kit, etc. It
        was also where I would eventually collect these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Lego Ninjago minifigures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DReCyGV.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        In Fuzhou, there was this park a long walk away that we went to often. It had a big lake area with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>weeping willows on the banks and vendors all along the paths bordering it</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kjivjCZ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        You could take boats onto the lake, though we only did this a few times. This is one of the places we would always take the volunteer teams that would come. Late October 2011, we were eating meatball subs one night when we started hearing
        this loud meowing outside our door. It didn't stop, and eventually we opened the door to see what it was. On the ground, a few feet from our door, was this tiny kitten. It was in terrible shape. Its fur was dirty and you could see its ribs.
        We didn't know it at the time, but it also had fleas. We brought out a small bowl with bits of meatball in it to see if it would eat, but after continuing to hear meows from outside our door we decided to bring him for the night. We cleaned
        him up and made him comfortable. In the coming days, we would get rid of the ticks and buy some watered down cat food to keep him going. We sent out ads for a cat that was available to adopt (my parents had no desire for a permanent pet at
        this point) but in the meantime

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we took care of him</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zezLijj.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We decided to name him Tex, short for Texas and the phrase "don't mess with Texas", which the Funderburk and Vaughn parents found really funny for some reason. A month or two after we found him, the Funderburk family adopted him from us. A
        few days after we found Tex, Kesed and Makaria got in trouble. My mom got a call from Mrs. Lee, who lived in the apartment strip across from us: "I see a little white hand and a little black hand throwing stuff out your window. Thought you
        might want to know." My mom went to the room in question and saw Kesed and Makaria chucking

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>anything they could find</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0aJaQQ.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        down into the

        below. My mom had to ask the downstairs neighbors to let her in so she could pick up the books and underwear in their bushes. Needless to say, Makaria and Kesed got into big trouble.

        We celebrated Reformation Day a bit late that year, on November 2nd. Normally, we celebrated it in the place of Halloween. To this day I still don't think I've gone trick-or-treating. This occasion, me and Selah prepared for an interview
        hosted by our mom. This time, we did research on the work of John Calvin.



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We wore this knitted beard in turn and answered questions</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9pYSQt.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (Enya, Dayu, the Lees, the Funderburks, and the two volunteers at the time were all there.) 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We then played "Pin the Petal on the Flower</u>,"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5KBq7xS.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        as per our tradition. I think it was petals and flowers because of John Calvin's quote about flowers (“Would the Lord have dressed the flowers with a beauty that runs freely to meet our eyes if it were wrong to be moved by such beauty?")

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Enya and Dayu participated in the game too</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/P99iilR.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I don't remember who won, but whoever did got a big bag of candy. Dayu won one year, and Makaria won another one.


        That November, my grandparents took my family and the McKowns on a two-week vacation in Thailand. These next accounts are only semi-chronological. This trip was the first time I realized I didn't like

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Pad Thai</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pMhNPwR.jpg" width="800" height="600" />



        <span> <u>We went swimming</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/snGoqg5.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        a whole bunch there, as you might expect. At one point, as I was walking barefoot across the wooden planks, my big toe caught in something and I got this huge blood blister. (No picture included) So that was painful. I have memories of three
        different games from this trip. My Grampa played Plants vs. Zombies a lot, and we all loved watching him. When I could, I would hide behind the couch and play it on Aiden's phone. Aiden himself would play this game where you could send out
        various tiers of stick figures to fight monsters once you earned enough money. It was the kind of game where people attack at a set speeds, and your goal is to get them to advance upon and destroy the enemy fortress. It was all about points
        conservation, in other words. You had to spend them wisely on the right troops. Anyway, I remember watching him play it a lot and strongly hinting that I wanted to play too. The one time I did get it he had to take it right back because his
        mom called him. The third game I remember from that trip was a word-finding game that Mimi (my mom's mom) would play on her iPad.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>She would let us play the game both on our own and with her a decent amount</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PX8WphF.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        One day on the trip, we went to an

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>elephant park</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YKbFnPu.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        We did all the normal things, like go to the soccer/art/

        show, take one on a ride, and go to the place where you could feed and pet one

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>up close</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9kPZC0r.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        There was one baby elephant that was especially cute. It had a bit of hair on its head, so it looked more like a kid as well. A few days later, my dad, Uncle Casey, and Grampa took the oldest 3 kids to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>go fishing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/2NfznOR.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        It was at a specific fishing place that made you let them go after you caught them. I remember how there were two lakes, one with piranhas and one with normal fish. Apparently there had been a leak recently and some piranhas had gotten into
        the regular area. I only caught one or two normal fish, but Aiden actually managed to catch a piranha. I remember Grampa joking with the fishing employee guy when they threw in the bait, saying "Chum! Chum!" when the bread crumb lumps would
        fall off the hook. I didn't get what they were talking about at the time. While we did that, I think the younger kids watched the Pippi Longstocking movie back at the house. From then on, all they (and eventually, I) did was sing the theme
        song. ("Pippi Longstocking, coming into your town. A friend of Tillytown, oh no no no.") We all got the little jingle in our heads. I critiqued, however, that it didn't make sense, because she was the hero of the story set in Tillytown, so it
        wouldn't make sense to say that she wasn't its friend. A day or two after we went fishing, we went to this night safari place. We saw a bunch of animals, but the only one I specifically remember was the zebra, because

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>it came right up to me</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cdw0WW9.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I remember that in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the waiting area for the safari place</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B0oiV78.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        there was one of those things that projected something onto the floor that you could interact with, usually by stomping on whatever you were supposed to stomp on. (It had little games on it.) Now, throughout the whole trip, I had been playing
        on the basketball hoop in the front area. This was the first time I had done anything relating to basketball, but I thought it was super fun. It had a chain net that made a super satisfying noise when you made a shot. I remember trying to
        make a total of 1000 shots over the course of the vacation, which I managed to do by shooting a lot. On that trip, the boys got these Thai boxing shorts (seen

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>here</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GRGx8qx.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        flexing next to the basketball hoop) and the girls got Thai dresses. Towards the end of this vacation, Selah and Grampa put on a puppet show for us. It was about a married

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Mrs. Kangaroo and Mr. Penguin</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pGqmOPO.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        At one point, Grampa (as the penguin) mentioned how he wanted fish. I then pointed out (from the audience) how penguins didn't eat fish, but krill. (I was in the middle of a penguin phase that lasted several years, so I knew quite a lot about
        them.) We took a bunch of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>family pictures</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9cYtDtU.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        towards the end of the trip. The McKowns would leave first. I remember being really sad as they loaded into the van. We left soon afterwards, but we didn't go right back to China. Instead, we went to visit the Shores. We had this bread dish
        called "Monkey Brain," which put me off before I realized it was pretty good. I think I spent a good amount of time looking for this Magic School Bus book about shrinking and going into the human body in their house. I'm not sure why I
        thought it was there though. I also made a big tower out of letter blocks. After a day at their house, we finally went back to China. A few days after that, I lost my first tooth. It was when we were doing church at the Funderburk's house. I
        went into the bathroom because my tooth had finally given way a whole bunch. After the getting-a-very-loose-tooth out routine, I remember being super happy that I had finally lost my first tooth. I had a plan to make a model of my childhood
        teeth by collecting them as the fell out and putting them into a clay model. Unfortunately, that plan didn't work out right away, because (I think) it fell into the toilet and was flushed away.

        In early December 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Altics</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1hCv9US.jpg" width="625" height="450" />

        came to visit. They did a whole bunch of stuff with us, but for some reason I wasn't there a lot of the time. I do have an isolated memory of being the person wrapped in toilet paper for a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>snowman contest</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CoQCyGU.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        held among this bible study group thing with college students, Mr. Gerald Lee, and the Altics. I thought my group easily did the best, but I don't remember if we won. At one point they went and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>helped move things out of one of the orphanages</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/a2wFY5Y.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        I think I didn't go on that one either because I had gotten in trouble or I had complained about the long walk. One night, my parents took them and us to this tea shop, where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>us kids watched a movie</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9i451x.jpg" width="800" height="554" />

        with Curious George and and an elephant while the adults talked to the store owner for a long time. Another thing we did was take them to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this long street</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/22AeqMH.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        my parents took all the visitors. I never liked going there, because it was a long walk away from our house. On December 18th, kids from the Vaughns, Lees, Funderburks and Chus performed a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Christmas skit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PmvqTHm.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        for all the adults. As we moved into late December, Makaria had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this performance for her youeryuan</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4ldiYqd.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        where she had to wear

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>an orange shirt that said "Teenie Weenie" on the front</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uunQ8UX.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        (It was the brand.) I remember how all the adults found it really funny, and some of the kids understood it some, but it's really funny looking back at it now.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Christmas morning</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/y27iJxB.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        we had cinnamon rolls for breakfast, as we often did. This Christmas was the first time I remember doing our long-standing Christmas tradition. As many 

        <span onmouseover="ontext41()"><u>past Christmases</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV41" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo41()" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo41()" onmouseout="offvideo41()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1efG_8hcEn0iAOakFyxUw_0gDzkJRBMdO" controls></video>

 as I could remember, my parents have never given us big gifts. They gave what fit into our stockings and maybe one or two
        small items, but that was it. They saw it as wasteful. (Needless to say, they never for a second had Santa Claus be a thing.) Instead of getting gifts, they had us kids (or at least all those old enough) to research a certain charity and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>give a presentation</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B0c7tZb.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        to the family about what it did, and my parents would donate the money that would have been spent on gifts on these charities instead. Now, as long as I can remember, my family has had a tradition called Family Night. Every Friday night, we
        would do some activity together. In recent years, the activity has mainly been movies, but in years past they could be game night, crafts night, or any other family bonding activity. (Us kids always preferred the movie nights, though.) Once
        or twice we even went to the movie theater to watch a movie there for Family Night. In Fuzhou, what we would often do is run to this convenience store on the way to LiHong's (our tutor, who you'll hear about later) house, get some drinks, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we would eat dinner</u> while we watched the movie.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W5SZG81.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

	Usually my parents picked awesome ones, but there was this one time... So they were looking for a movie one time, and they found this one 'flick' (as they called movies sometimes - when they did, I always thought of the movie A Bug's Life, for some reason) that looked fun enough. Well, turns out it was about this parallel universe where the other mom tries to sew buttons into the main character's eyes. Yep, they had picked Coraline. Apparently, it had looked like just a normal kids movie on the page they got it, and the ratings hadn't given any indication otherwise. Nonetheless, this was the first movie we considered stopping halfway through. I especially was SUPER scared. I really didn't like it. It completely creeped me out. I might not have been as scared if it wasn't dark, at night. In the end, though, we did finish it.

        <a id="2012.tag"><u></u></a>

        January 2012 finally rolled around.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I turned 8</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MSmQgc8.jpg" width="800" height="560" />

        In that picture, I'm holding one of the posters my family made. We have a ton of birthday traditions. The night before, we set out handmade posters from each one of us along the pathway leading out their door. The birthday person has no
        chores, and they can pick any dinner and any movie they want. At dinner, after we've all finished eating, we go around and say what we love about them. We go youngest to oldest, though skipping over my dad. He gets to say as many as he wants
        once everyone else is finished. That was always his thing. When it's his birthday, us kids would sometimes clamor to be that person, but it would always fall to my mom. Oftentimes, especially in later years, the kids would combine their funds
        to buy a gift, and my parents would get the big gift you would look forward to all year.

        One thing we did for fun a lot around this time was make these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>domino lines with little plastic squares</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j82MgvT.jpg" width="400" height="600" />


        from some homeschool set. 

        <span onmouseover="ontext45()">(<u>Here</u></span>

 you can see Selah and Lisa doing that while the younger kids watch Anais do Stickman Epic.)

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV45" width="608" height="1080" onload="offvideo45()" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo45()" onmouseout="offvideo45()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1onAlVZgCmB6R4qw1Cq3ZCgR7U_QSVbFn" controls></video>

 Which for some reason reminds me of this. During our first year in Fuzhou, we somehow met these two French/Chinese/Japanese/Cantonese girls, Lisa and Anaïs Herberger. Lisa is between my and Selah's age, and Anais is
        a bit older than Charis. I don't remember how we did meet them, but we did, and they were us five's best friends for the entire 4 years we were there. We went to their house (which was super nice and had two floors due to them being at the
        top of their building) for their birthday parties,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>they came over for ours (middle)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uRQ86CU.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

        every single day when we finished our work we went outside to play with them. At the time we met them, they knew/were learning 7 languages. When we met them, I think their younger brother, Antoni, had just been born. Lisa is the girl I next
        remember liking. When I went on statesides or vacations and saw Anna again, I would start liking her again, but Lisa was the main one for Fuzhou. every once in a while I would look at Lani Lee or Chayli Funderburk with a bit of interest, but
        not for very long. They lived 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>right behind us</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9UMh0S3.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

 in the apartment complex directly across this metal gate we easily slipped through all the time. That reminds me. There was this one guy that would always wander around our neighborhood. He had a
        potbelly and might have been drunk 24/7, not in a scary violent way, more in a dazed, lazy, staring way. We named him Albert. Anyway, one day Albert watched us squeeze through the gate to get to Anais and Lisa's apartment area. A few minutes
        later he waddled over and tried to get through himself. We all stopped and watched as he became hopelessly stuck. After a few more grunts, he gave up, pushed himself out, and walked away, scratching his butt. We just burst out laughing.

        Late January 2012, we went to Thailand for another trip, either a vacation or a conference. This time in Thailand, I remember walking through street markets to get to this food court, where me, Charis, and my dad tried to find taxis from all
        colors of the rainbow through the window. We met with



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Masseys and the Shores</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/q2cKql8.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

        and hung out with them for the whole trip. I actually remember walking out to the area where we took that picture. I was thinking about paper-mâché at the time, maybe something to do with how we would paper-mâché a balloon to get

        the piñatas

        we would always have at birthday parties. Anna gave me

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this hand-made wooden plane</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sVVz6xw.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        she made as a birthday present. My parents gave me

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the 2012 Guinness World's Records book</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N6pxsuj.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I read that book so often over the next few years until the cover then the pages came off the spine. One of the things we did with the Masseys was go bowling. I just remember that they put up the bumpers for me and Anna, because we weren't
        very good. Soon after, we met up with the Peeks to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>ride elephants</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CQNBDcL.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        A few days later, we went back to Fuzhou.

        By February 2012, my mom had worked on

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>her book</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KgCZuJm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        for several months. She was really proud of the title. I think Aunt Kim designed the cover. I remember how my mom stopped her from putting a little smiley face in the top left corner as a little Easter egg thing. Anyways, in early March, two
        volunteers came that would be one of the few volunteer groups I remember clearly. Their names were

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Tim and Patrick</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fGBHAa4.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (Tim is on the upper left, Patrick is front and center.) We hung out with them a TON. I think they were there for 6 months all together, which is probably why I remember them so clearly. I remember how Tim could beatbox really well, and us
        kids loved it. We would go on the "beatbox train," where we would hang onto his back as he walked around the living room beatboxing. We thought it was just the best thing ever. Patrick was super fun too, though. Both of them were around for a
        super long time, and I think came on several different occasions. It was somewhere around this time that I met

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Immanuel</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3y8YAUt.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        He was a Korean kid who lived nearby. In fact, he was the only foreign boy near my age in the entire neighborhood. The Herbergers, Lees, Chus, and Funderburks (with the exception of Drew, who was 7-8 years older than me) all had families of
        2-3 girls only in each. I remember when I first met him. He and his dad came up to the Vaughn/Lisa-Anais group when we were playing in the empty square area. He said how he had heard there was a new foreign kid in the neighborhood, and he
        introduced the two of us. One of the first things we did was walk down our apartment strip and on into the next, talking about whatever. At the end of the second strip, we went in this little bamboo forest area. I think we got sticks there as
        well. Anyway, around there I asked him if he was a Christian, because I didn't want him being a non-Christian to get in the way. He said yes, as could be seen in his name, and I realized where I recognized the name "Immanuel" from. We became
        super good friends. I went over to his house for a bunch of sleepovers, and we would always play Minecraft, the demo version though. I loved it. One time, Kesed came with me, and after nagging and nagging us to let him play, we finally let
        him get it a few minutes before we had to leave. We gave him a gold sword, telling him it was the best one in the game (it's not) and we turned it to Hard difficulty when he went into the other room. Needless to say, he died in like 5
        seconds. At Immanuel's house I think I would have those tiny raisin boxes with the girl on the front. They were pretty good. On one sleepover, I was super hyper. I kept talking and he wanted me to go to sleep. In what I now realize was an
        excellent strategy, he told me that he had this thing where he had tons of negative emotions inside and normally let out 1% during the day, and how he needed to release more of it at night, so I should be quiet to let him do it. I questioned
        that idea at first, but he told me Obama said it was true, so I went quiet. I remember standing with Immanuel on a bridge over the canyon structure and listening to

        <span onmouseover="ontext24()"><u>Gangnam Style</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV24" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo24()" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo24()" onmouseout="offvideo24()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gyW0Igo7pgBKOWtR4wR7DguiMJuHrb4y" controls></video>

        for the first time. One time, we followed a trail of bird feathers into a hole into the ground. We felt so excited and apprehensive about "tracking down a snake." I also have memories of him calling his dad in Korean and asking if we could
        come over for the afternoon. That was when he was on top of this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>giant ladybug thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/2aD5f1x.jpg" width="400" height="650" />

        in the playground on the opposite apartment strip. There were I think two of those, and one of them had a hole in it, so we could go inside, since it was hollow. This was the playground where I would curl up in the plastic tube parts reading the one or two Spiderman comic books I had found somewhere. (maybe a garage/yard sale or something?) There's another story with this playground, which I'll get to in a minute.
        Immanuel is also where I learned about

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Ninjago</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fD52gik.jpg" width="650" height="400" />

        Geronimo Stilton, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (of which I liked the brown one, because it had a lot of boy/girl stuff,)

        and this other book series about a newt. (I once got in trouble because I read one of the newt books on the way back from his house, and I apparently lost track of time and was an hour late. My dad had to come out and find me, and I wasn't
        allowed to read the book before the day I had to return it.) We watched Ninjago all the time with him. Only Season 2 though. Me and Kesed loved it, and one time we asked my parents to let us watch some for family night. Finally, they said
        yes, and one day (I think right after running, another thing I'll talk about) my dad took me over to Immanuel's house and we got the disks. I had been super impatient about getting them the past two weeks and my dad told me that they had
        everything planned out. The first and only night we watched it, we only did one or two, because each episode was 45 minutes, instead of 15 minutes like I thought/told my parents. Another thing I did with Immanuel a couple times was wrestle. I
        had the quickness, and he had the strength and weight. Come to think of it, I wrestled with a lot of people, Kesed especially. We were more physically matched in Fuzhou than we would be in Qingdao, so we went at it all the time. Each
        apartment strip had this rain drain

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sewer-like system</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zfzXTh6.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        It was pretty easy to get into, and it was super fun being able to get from place to place underground. It was only about 6-7 ft deep, and concrete grates covered the top. We used it to travel/sneak around as well as find bamboo sticks
        (ranging in length from dagger to spear) to fight with. Speaking of bamboo sticks, there was this one time with Anais that I was SUPER proud of at the time. We were arguing over who this one stick belonged to. We were at a deadlock until I
        thought of an idea. I asked her in a challenging tone, "did you put it in that exact place?" (pointing to some random place to the side.) She said "Yes! I put it right there, for sure. See, I know where it was. It's mine, give it." I then
        shot back in triumph, "Well, I didn't really find it there. I found it a lot farther away, so this must be mine, and you just made it up that you put this one here!" She didn't have anything to say in response, realizing she had made a
        mistake. I felt soooo proud of myself at the time. In fact, I went up and called my mom from the window, telling her of my clever plan to get the stick.

        In early April 2012, my family went up a mountain with Tim and Patrick around the time of the sweeping of the tombs holiday. I remember stopping for a break while we

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>took a picture</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OOpccS9.jpg" width="533" height="800" />

        and taking a (maybe glass-bottomed)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>gondola</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0bWvdlN.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        on the way down. About a week afterwards, the boys and girls

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>went into mosquito tents on each of our porches</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3z5IYMY.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        to go "camping." We brought out flashlights and everything. We didn't even sleep there, though. Something happened, maybe it was too hot or something, but eventually we all went back inside. I should mention a bit about our homeschooling
        stuff. To teach us typing, my mom used <a href="https://www.dancemattypingguide.com">Dancemat Typing</a>. We used that website for a LONG time. For science, me/Charis/Selah were all on one curriculum, and Kesed/Makaria did some small
        activities on the side. The oldest three had a textbook, online stuff, and a kit full of things like test tubes, magnifying glasses, and crafts. I used magnifying glasses to burn ants (no, I'm not a psychopath, and yes, they smelled like
        grilled meat) and try to make fires with dead grass and leaves. We did experiments included in the course and made up by my mom. We did

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>baking soda volcanos</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FVZj38d.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and we once salted a slug when we did our biology course. It wasn't pretty. In a few minutes, it had bubbled, swelled up, and died. We had a whole bunch of strategies to make homeschool interesting. One we did for a while was stations,
        where we rotate between math, history, science, reading, handwriting, games, etc. every 30-45 minutes, counted using this animal noise timer app.

        But back to the main timeline. On April 22nd, Tim from 'Tim and Patrick' got baptized. I think he had gotten baptized when he was a baby, and he wanted to do it again, so

        <span onmouseover="ontext5()"><u>my dad baptized him</u>.</span>

        In Fuzhou, we were introduced to four thus-far new modes of transportation: 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bikes</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XpL7Xuf.jpg"/>

        (Side note, because this doesn't really fit anywhere else - Lisa and Anais had wheelies, normals shoes that had wheel come out the bottom if you positioned them a certain way. We were all super jealous of them, but we never ended up getting any because they were so expensive.) At night, this area was filled with palm-sized toads jumping between the lampposts. I would always catch it and pet it on the way home. But yeah. April to June 2012 was the time when I wrote most of 

        <span onmouseover="ontext52(); flexible();"><u>my Garageband songs</u>.</span>

 I guess I had just gotten my drums and all, but I was super in the creative spirit. I spent TONS of time on these, and I loved how easy it was to mix different instruments I didn't even know how to play.

 I especially liked using all the synth instruments, as you can probably tell.

 Early May 2012, Charis was riding one of those things in the empty square near our house when she fell
        over and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>broke her arm</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yoin9yv.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I just remember coming home from somewhere else and seeing my dad holding her arm wrapped in a blanket. She and my mom went to Hong Kong for about a week to get it taken care of. Since she broke her right arm, she had to learn how to use her
        left arm. This led to her being a bit more ambidextrous than the rest of us for a while. (Me and Kesed are left handed, possibly from Mimi, who's left handed as well.) I think it was only a few days after that where Kesed hurt his toe. He was
        carrying this big rock from one place to another (who knows why) all by himself (despite us offering help) when he suddenly dropped it onto his toe. I remember him crying and it bleeding a ton, grossing me out.

        We got roller blades from somewhere, I'm not sure where. I think it was just me and Selah who got them. I had some orange ones, and she had some blue ones. I couldn't do it for very long each time, though, because it would rub against the
        sides of my ankles and chafe the skin.

        Now's a time as good as any to talk about my reading while in Fuzhou. Fuzhou is really the place where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got into reading</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gkBv1uH.jpg" width="525" height="600" />

        I had known how to read since the age of 2, of course, but I hadn't really read for fun. This changed in Fuzhou. I think the first series I read in full was Narnia, but after that the order kind of mixes up. Here's a roughly chronological
        order of book series (with lengths): the Clone Wars - novel version (1),

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Gulliver's Travels (kids version)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Rc2p5f.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        Junie B. Jones (a bunch), Lord of the Rings (3), Fablehaven (5), Hunger Games (3), Percy Jackson (5), Eragon (3), Geronimo Stilton - Kingdom of Fantasy (6), Divergent (2 of 3), Land of Stories (6), the Star Wars Sextology (6), and most likely
        a couple more that I just can't remember. My mom tried getting me into the Hardy Boys, but they were boring. It took me a while to get into Hunger Games, because I quit at first after reading the first few pages, saying that "this is just
        about some cat." Eventually, though, my parents persuaded me to read the rest, and I loved it. Our family has a policy that if one of us wants to see the movie adaption of some book, we have to fully read the book first. Most of our books
        were on the Kindle app on our iPads, with the exceptions being Fablehaven, Narnia, and Lord of the Rings. I think I was the first one to finish Lord of the Rings. Before I began, I had heard my dad talk in some restaurant about how he was
        reading it, but I had assumed it was some theology thing, since it had the word 'Lord' in it. I remember watching each movie after I had finished the accompanying book with my dad in the living room at night. On the last one, Selah made us
        popcorn that was way too salty. (Random... also, we always made popcorn at home in a wok filled with vegetable oil. It was cheaper and actually a lot healthier, since we never put butter on. My parents never let us have things like mayonnaise
        and butter because they didn't want us developing a taste for it.) Anyways, I remember crying at the last scene. My dad put his arm around me and quoted one of the lines from the movie: "Not all tears are evil.". I was really slow on the
        Divergent series, and I never got to the last one. It just kind of got boring. Fablehaven was super fun though. I remember first seeing them in our bags coming back from some conference. They were in one of those plastic holders book series
        come in. I remember how I read the 1st book in 1 day, and the 2nd book in 2 days. I wanted to keep that pattern, but I couldn't because I got in trouble on the 3rd day of the 3rd book and had to go to bed early. So I finished that one in 4
        days. I then continued on to finish the 4th one in 4 days and the 5th one in 5 days. I was super sad when it ended. I kind of just laid in my bed with watery eyes as I put the book to the side. Around the time I started getting into reading,
        my dad started reading with us kids at night. I think the first book he read was the Hobbit. That was really fun. Then we read 100 Cupboards, which was a bit creepy but still kinda fun. Then we got to Harry Potter. We would end up reading the
        entire series of Harry Potter this way, with him reading to us sprawled out on the couch, over the course of both Fuzhou and Qingdao. Before we started, I was slightly against it, because I thought it was some horror book. I think the last
        one had come out pretty recently (Editor's note - the last movie came out July 15, 2011), so I was seeing these scary posters about them everywhere. Randomly, around this age I constantly had Chinese people come up to me and say I looked like
        Harry. It must have been the glasses. I did have decently round glasses at that point.

        Not too far from our house was a 

public swimming pool.

 We went there pretty often. It had a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>kids pool</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/grCPlkX.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 and an 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u> adult pool</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ajF3z6k.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 I remember going through the changing room with all the naked Chinese guys changing on both sides. We
        had to step through this foot-cleaning pool before we stepped into the main area. I thought that part was gross. Eventually I started avoiding the kids pool when I realized how often they were peeing in it. This is also where I realized I
        needed goggles that covered the nose, unlike the other kids. I still don't know how people swim with the smaller ones. They're super uncomfortable for me. We would always get our goggles and other swim stuff at the pool store they had next
        to/in front of the adult pool. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We played tons of games</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uxDubSU.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 when we went (often with groups of other kids/families), like Colored Eggs, Marco Polo, and a few other games I can't remember. Colored Eggs is this one game Anais and Lisa taught us.
        It's where everyone chooses a color, and the person that's It calls out colors one at a time with their eyes closed and tries to catch people as they try to reach the other side. The first person to get caught is the next one It. One time, we
        were playing this out of the pool, in the empty square, and Selah didn't specify which category of color we were allowed to choose from. (I chose 'clear'.) They couldn't guess mine after an hour, and they continued to guess over the next few
        days. I teased them with stuff like "it's all around you" and "it's the most common color in the world." Eventually, when I told them, they got all mad and told me that I had cheated. But back to the pool. One time, when we were going on a
        pool trip, we had just left that in-between-apartment-strips area down a long, wide ramp leading to the road with the pool when we saw this huge dog/wolf thing. (We would always call it 'the wolf'.) It had tangly, matted gray fur, a foaming
        mouth, and dirty, broken strands of a rope attached to its neck. Maybe I was just small, but it looked huge. (Judging from my mom's reaction, it actually WAS huge.) My mom (it was just her that day) dragged all the kids to the side, behind
        one of the bushes that lined the ramp. She held us behind her and the stroller as she watched the wolf's every move. She told us to be quiet. There was also these two other women on the ramp. One was old (maybe in her 70s), and I think the
        other one was in her 50s. The older lady had bags of groceries in her hands, but she dropped them when the wolf started up the ramp. She ran a safe distance away and started screaming at it. The wolf moseyed around and slowly approached the
        groceries. It began poking around, then eating all of the groceries she had just bought, while the lady herself screamed her lungs out at it. I'm not sure what happened after that. Most likely, my mom edged along the wall and we all went off
        the other side of the ramp towards the pool. Later, when we returned to the area where the wolf had been, we saw a few drops of what looked like dried blood where there hadn't been any before. We established the theory that the old ladies had
        called the police, who had come and shot it.

        Late May, we began having huge fruit fly problems. They were everywhere, and they were super annoying. We tried all sorts of tricks. We did the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>paper funnel trap</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BVQ9Pa9.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        with meat / honey / fruit at the bottom (it worked because the flies were too dumb to fly back through the hole but were willing to fly in through the top), slapping them by hand, and anything else we could find online. We caught a ton, but
        there was always more. After a few weeks of this, I was digging around in the girls room when I found this old plastic bag. It was disgusting. I think it had rotting fruit (maybe banana?) in there, but there were bunches of fly eggs, tons of
        white fly larvae crawling around and of course adult flies everywhere. Needless to say, after we got rid of that bag, the flies mostly went away. Another pest problem we had in Fuzhou was with cockroaches. I think they were the fat Texas
        cockroaches (no picture included), but most of the ones we saw were the nymphs. They were most common in the kids' bathroom. I'm pretty sure this was real, and not a nightmare, but I remember going to the bathroom one night, turning on the
        lights, and seeing the floor COVERED with cockroaches, who then all scattered to the walls. I jumped onto the walls and held myself above the ground until they were all gone. I remember that LiHong recommended this one strategy that actually
        worked pretty well. It was this kind of cockroach poison that attracted other roaches to eat the bodies of the dead ones, killing them and continuing the cycle. It was effective because the initial roach would often die inside the nest,
        allowing the poison to reach past the little paste tablets we would set down on the bathroom floor.

        so you can have a checkpoint for what I looked like at this point in my life. That summer, we watched the Olympics nonstop. The biggest events for us were swimming, gymnastics, and occasionally running. (My mom also has a close personal friend who's an Olympic gold medalist in diving [Laura Wilkinson], so we watched a bit of diving as well.) Almost every day, my parents would put on the Olympics for us all to watch. One day, we kids made the discovery that

        </span>



 for the Olympics ['Bugler's Dream'] was on our 'Classical Music' app, and some of us decided to have some fun with it. We hooked an iPad up to the speakers, and played the theme song out loud in the living room. Kesed came running out instantly, with Booboo (his bear stuffed animal) and blanket in tow. We all laughed at his expense, and he went back to his room, disappointed. Despite this, we REPEATED the trick one or two more times, and somehow he kept being fooled every single time. That was super funny. (Side note, while on the subject of pranks - one time, Selah (helped by the others + Lisa/Anais) pranked me by putting plastic wrap over the toilet seat. Needless to say, I was not very happy. I made Selah clean it all up.)

        The next big event was the arrival of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Paige (top center) and Lydia (upper right)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HKW3PXY.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        the next significant set of volunteers. I remember Paige a lot more than Lydia. Not only did she visit us later right after we moved to Qingdao, but she was the one who taught us this "doi doi doi" thing. When you put your hands a certain way
        over your mouth and say "girl" in a super deep voice, it sounds like you're saying "doi" in a super high pitched voice. I remember that VERY clearly because of

        <span onmouseover="ontext8()"><u>how entertaining it was for us</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV8" width="800" height="600" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo8()" onload="offvideo8()" onmouseout="offvideo8()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14zmL2OKGZ86-d350kLxptOfBNj6omnfU" controls></video>

        At the time I also liked Paige because I thought she was really pretty, but hey, that was just me. They were there for two weeks, I think, but they stick out I think because of that doi doi doi thing. They hung out with Selah and my mom the
        most. Paige did some spa thing with my mom, thats all I remember specifically.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We took them</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/mLbBdvp.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        to all the usual places, and we did a ton of stuff with them at the regular orphanage /

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with girls from that orphanage</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/c2kOiyh.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        (I think that one was when Selah invited them to have a sleepover at the orphanage, and she acted as their translator as a 10 year old.) Selah was at that orphanage a lot. She helped out / joined tons of teams and summer camps to help the
        kids there. That was kind of how she first got the "responsible one" reputation, because she was doing so much at such a young age.

        Now I feel like I should cover my Xiaoxue experiences all in one go. I started going to my Chinese elementary school on

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>August 30th 2012</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zU5mi1G.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        I was there all up until 3rd grade, after which we moved to Qingdao. I only remember four of my classmates' faces. Two of them were the class "leaders." I'm not sure why I thought of them that way, maybe they were the official class leaders
        or something. It was one guy and one girl, and they were both pretty nice to me. I remember at one point I went to the front of the class to arm wrestle the leader boy. (I'm not sure why we were doing this in class.) We were deadlocked for a
        whole minute, with the other kids cheering both of us on, and eventually I let him win so we both could end it. (No, that's not my excuse, that really was my motivation.) They could get bossy at times, which is maybe why I think of them as
        being in charge. The third girl was a bit chubby, and had darker skin and curlier hair than the rest of the kids. My mom theorized that she was mixed. She was super nice. And
        lastly, I remember the face of this one kid that was super mean to me. He and his friends would always gang up on me, cursing me out and saying other mean things. I actually didn't know the meaning of the word he used towards me most often,
        (what I learned many years later was the Chinese equivalent of the F-word), just that he said it when he was mad. Not knowing what it meant, I used it whenever I was mad, especially towards him. That would always make him angry, which was
        satisfying. He also repeated this rhyme he had a ton. “范勇强，不吃中国的白米饭，只吃美国的黑炸弹。“ ("Malachi doesn't eat China's white rice, only America's black bombs.") I didn't really get what it meant, so I would simply corrected him by saying that I ate
        rice for lunch every day when I went home. The one time I remember him repeating that the most was as we were lining up after exiting the bus for a field trip. Now, these field trips were a big deal for us kids. We would get our raincoats
        ready just in case and pack a lunch the day before. We were always so excited. There are two places I remember going to often, and one place I remember going to once. One was this huge forest area where we would walk through the trees and
        enjoy nature. The second one we went to often was this small amusement park area where you paid for each ride you went on. As a result, the class was limited to a certain number of rides, and we all had to decide on which ones we wanted to go
        on. On one occasion, we all voted to go through the haunted house as the last ride of the day, which I had been eyeing for a while. As we went through single file, the other kids got freaked out, and everyone started to push forward in an
        attempt to run faster. I was super enthusiastic, though, and I wanted to stop so I 1, could get the full experience of the house, and 2, show off to my classmates how brave I was. But the people behind me kept pushing, and so I was forced out
        with everyone else. I just remember seeing the crying face of the bully guy in front of me and feeling really smug. When we were all outside lining up, everyone was quiet, but I was super energetic. The third place, the one I only remember
        going to once, was this ship-building museum that was in the middle of a shipyard. There were huge metal frames and towering cranes all over the place, and scrap metal littered the ground to the sides of the path. It was a pretty boring
        museum, and I complained about it when we got back. For all of these field trips, we had to bring our own lunches. Lunchtime on these events was a big thing. It was where everyone compared meals and traded choice food items. I especially
        loved it because my mom would always buy more snack food for these trips than we normally got at home, like full

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>rolls of hawthorn flakes</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/nVsMgTI.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        on my 8th grade fall trip. The fruit itself isn't very good though. It's way too sour.) I was always proud of how generous I was with my food. I always shared with all of my classmates. So those were the field trips. I remember a couple other
        things that happened at that school as well. I once beat 5 Chinese kids in a fight in the courtyard.

        <span>(<u>This picture</u> includes the white things/middle apartment complex area on the top left (our apartment strip is the tall buildings with red roofs also on the top left), and my elementary school on the bottom left, including the
          soccer field and the aforementioned courtyard in the middle of the square building arrangement. You can <i>just</i> see the one and only tree in that courtyard where I always hung around during recess.)

        </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sTIVqrD.jpg" width="950" height="588" />

        It was during recess, when everyone was running around doing whatever. I don't remember what I normally did during this time. I think I either wandered around or looked at dirt/the only tree in the courtyard to see if I could find anything
        interesting. Things like that. Anyways, I just remember becoming really excited when I saw the fight was coming, and excitedly bragging about how I had won when I got home. In what I think was my first year at this school, they did this
        soccer program with the entire student body. We all had to bring our own soccer balls in these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>netted ball-holder things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8kvQt8W.jpg" width="500" height="500" />

        (I had a black and shiny neon-ish green one, and Charis had a 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>gold and black</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/F6zaEJh.jpg"/>

 one.) Me and Charis always kicked them as we walked on the way to school. Every day at the same time, everyone in the school would be led out to the soccer field in the back. We would always do some stretches (including the rolling wrist/ankle
        ones) first, and if it was a Monday we would salute to the Chinese national anthem. They would make us hold the salute position for a long time while either student leaders or teachers came by to inspect us. We had to hold our hand in an
        exact way, and our feet had to be very close together. (For many years afterwards, when I was standing at rest anywhere else, I would notice that my feet were super close together. I think this is why.) I remember arguing with my classmate
        about the national anthem. At one part, they talk about overcoming the enemy's cannon fire, but the word they use for enemy, 敌人 (di ren) sounded a lot like 'demon' to me. (Chinese has a lot of words that sound exactly like their English
        translations, like ka fei (coffee) and qiao ke li (chocolate).) I argued that no, no matter how bad the Japanese (I assumed that's who it was referring to) were, they weren't DEMONS. My classmate argued back that yes, they were <i>di ren</i>.
        After we had stretched and done all the intro stuff, we would start our soccer stuff. We would do and then a soccer dance that involved various moves and drills, all to the song "Waka waka" by Shakira (the 2010 World Cup song). Every time I
        hear that song now it makes me thing of those times on the field dribbling around a soccer ball. We would then walk off through the right side of the school building with "Baby" by Justin Bieber playing through the speakers. That one doesn't
        have quite the memory connection the Shakira one does, though. There was this wall on the side of the ramp leading from the back of the school. A lot of times kids would climb all along the edge. One time, I climbed higher than I had ever
        seen anyone else climb before. I'm not sure why I did it. Maybe it was to impress the other kids/peer pressure. By the time I got to around the top, I was ready to get down. I must have been around three meters up, though. I paused for a long
        time, the kids on the ground egging me on. Finally, I jumped, landing on my feet but hurting my knees/ankles and getting myself scraped up on the ground. At one point in the latter years of school, they held this competition among all
        students in the school. At the event itself, we would have to pack a bunch of school supplies into our bags, then tie our shoes. (And maybe a few other of those type-things as well.) We practiced for the competition weeks in advance. I kept
        not being able to practice during class, because I would forget to bring my string-tied shoes and instead wore my velcro ones. I undid the velcro straps in order to simulate shoestrings a tiny bit better, but the teacher still kept having to
        remind me what shoes to bring next time. When it got to the actual competition, I tried my best (using shoestring shoes for the first time), but a ton of other kids finished before me. (We were lined up in row upon row of desks on the field,
        with the school supplies spread out on the desk and shoes untied.)

        I never did my Chinese homework in school. At least, I didn't do it consistently. When I could, I would do it, but I wasn't very good at doing my Chinese classwork. I did do the rest of it though. (Apparently, my parents let my
        teachers know beforehand that they weren't too concerned with me homework stuff, since I had homeschooling work to do at home as well. I didn't know that at the time, though. I found this out many years later.) Another iffy thing I often did
        in Chinese class was cheat off of classmates during tests. My teacher once gave a talk about cheating, but she said that it was fine, because we were taking the risk that our classmate had the wrong answer. I went home and told my parents
        about it, and they told me that I still shouldn't cheat because it's not right, and said "you're not cheating, right?", to which I nodded and said "Of course. Yeah, no." So not my best moment. Besides Chinese, I think the other classes I had
        were math, music, and social studies. I only remember one thing from music class. At one of our practice sessions for some concert, we stood on some bleachers in the music room for what felt like several hours. I was in the back row, so
        eventually I was able to squat down behind the others for short bursts of time. Near that room, on the second floor of the building, we watched "the Ant Bully" in a darkened room. One of the things I did to entertain myself in some of my
        regular classes was write all the Chinese characters I knew that didn't have a "一" in its character. I remember my classmates surrounding me as I explained what I was doing in the notebook. There are only a few more things I remember from
        this school. One day, I had a period where I realized something and thought for a super long time about why we are here. Obviously I knew all the Bible stuff, but it was a moment of thought to look back and see how generation after generation is born, lives similar lives, and dies, over and over and over again. That afternoon, when I got back home, my parents helped talk me through those kinds of questions. At one point, I began drawing Bible scenes on the bottom left corner of the blackboard during breaks. I think I hoped that someone would ask me what I was doing, and I would have an opportunity to talk to them about the Bible.
        I'm not sure, but I think it worked a bit. I remember getting into a conversation with the boy beside me about whether he wanted a Bible. I think it was during class and he was more trying to listen to the teacher, but I kept nagging him
        until I think he said yes just to make me be quiet. I went hope super happy, explaining to my parents how I had shared the gospel with someone and now they wanted a Bible. I told them I wanted to give him the blue book of kids' Bible stories.
        They were a bit more hesitant about the situation, and they told me to keep talking to the kid before we gave away one of our Bibles to them. I was disappointed at the time, but now I see that I was moving a bit quick, not to mention that
        handing out Bible stuff would have been a bit of a security liability. Now, the Fuzhou dialect is very different from Mandarin, and we heard it being spoken every so often. When our teachers tried teaching us the dialect in class, though, my
        parents told all of us not to listen and to do whatever we wanted at our desks. They didn't want our pronunciation messed up by mixing the two, which was a good call, because the sharp pronunciation skills practiced through going Chinese
        school would give me a huge advantage later on. A few more small stories I remember from Chinese school. One time, they were giving a lesson on how we could make little sayings to remember the composition of a character. (It'll make sense in a second.) They asked if any of us had any of these of our own, and if we would present the saying to try and get the class to guess the character. I had been thinking for a while, and finally I raised my hand, and I proudly marched up to the front of the room and said "白色的王坐在石头上“, what I meant as 'the white king sat on the rock." This was supposed to reference the character ”碧“， which has 白 [white], 王 [king]，and 石 [rock]. I guess the way I said it wasn't correct or wasn't clear, because I remember everyone staring back at me, having no clue as to what character I was talking about. That was a bit embarrassing/frustrating, since I had been so proud of coming up with such a good memory 'jingle'. Another thing I remember: When we learned the character '黄', my teacher told us that we should never forget how to write it, since her name was 黄老师.

        So that was school. Back at home, there were tons of things to do. Some of us (ahem Selah) would draw or play her guitar/flute, some would build train tracks or wooden house things, but mostly we would just play around with whatever we had
        (like the superman cape in

        and especially towards the end years we would play games on our iPads/Leapsters/Didjs. First, iPads. Our Grampa (my mom's dad) likes to update his technology every time a new version comes out, and he gives each of the old versions to us /
        our cousins. Because of this, we had enough iPads for each kid to have one to themselves. I think it worked out so the older we were the newer model we got, but we all had ones that were decently old. Kesed and Makaria had the ones with the
        really old interface, and me/maybe Charis/Selah got the ones with a similar interface to iPads today. The games we would play on these were almost never the mindless games most kids these days play. They were either educational games or
        strategy/puzzle games. (Although most of the educational games we played were on the Leapfrogs/Didjs.) The biggest games we played (Ticket to Ride and Risk were especially common on dates with dad) were

        which was only on the older iPads. I attribute a ton of my logical abilities now to their decision to only allow those types of games. Because the games we played all involved critical thinking, all of us kids were actually learning from
        them, as opposed to all the kids in the world playing Angry Birds or Call of Duty. (One time, my parents accidentally bought / hacker made us download several brainless games, I think Subway Surfer and a couple of car racing games, which surprised us kids. My parents realized pretty quick, though, and those didn't last on our iPads for very long.) Whenever we went on visa runs, we would each bring our iPads on the plane/train to play. The thing was, for I think our entire time in China, you couldn't use
        your devices until 20 minutes into the flight, and you had to put them away 20 minutes before landing, which was frustrating for us kids.

        The specifically educational apps we had on the iPads were the Learn series ones, Reading Rainbow, Brainpop (which was also a website on the computer), 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Super Why</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BHUU5bR.jpg" width="600" height="316.5"/>

 (each of us corresponded to one of the characters, and I'm pretty sure you'll be able to guess which is which), Spelling City, Stack the Countries/States, Math Ninja, Word/Math Bingo,

        The second thing we would play games on was our

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Leapsters</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/bf8sE6K.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        They had

        that would go in the top, each its own game. They were all legit games in an educational format. I didn't complain. I loved them. We had ones from Madagascar, Cars, Finding Nemo, Thomas and Friends, the Backyardigans, Spiderman, Dora's
        Wildlife Rescue, "Draw and Write," "Animal Genius," and an Incredibles one that didn't work.

        I remember being scared of some of the scenes, though.

        <span onmouseover="ontext10()"><u>One such scene in the Madagascar one gave me nightmares</u>)</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV10" width="586" height="440" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo10()" onload="offvideo10()" onmouseout="offvideo10()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sfrTaeyb-I3cSJ5fmfKt5kv3CV3J0BT9" controls></video>

        because 1, the zebra disappears out of nowhere, and 2, I didn't like them gasping, "it's the man!" because it made me feel like someone who was hunting me had finally found me. Putting those two together, maybe I thought the zebra had been
        kidnapped or something.

        One of those games that I played a lot was Animal Genius. It had tons of little minigames to learn about animals in various biomes, and I thought it was super interesting. There was one type of minigame that I loved the most, and they all
        followed the same basic format: you were some animal that was trying to go around and eat a certain something (like anteater/ants and zebra/grass). On some of them, a predator would be roaming around trying to hunt you, which both made it
        harder and more fun. The one that I remember the clearest was the clownfish one, maybe because I connected it to Finding Nemo, which I really liked at the time. In

        <span onmouseover="ontext11()"><u>that game</u>,</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV11" width="640; height:360" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo11()" onload="offvideo11()" onmouseout="offvideo11()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ljjpICVKZKTGjU9qr5wW_5RpByd2rMyE" controls></video>

        you had to eat plankton while also hiding in sea anemones to avoid the grouper, which would try to hunt you down. To this day, when I listen to the music change that signifies the grouper has started chasing you, I can feel my
        fear/stress/anxiety start to rise. The trains from "Thomas and Friends" also creeped me out, though I did like finding these hidden blue tickets that were scattered around in that game.

        The third thing we used for games was our

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Didjs</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MMYqB7Q.jpg" width="542" height="600" />

        Me and Selah both had one, as I remember.

        The games were more advanced, and they had more actual gameplay than the previous games. (They were still educational, though.) I remember 4 games in particular:


        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a SpongeBob/Tiger guy/Danny Phantom one</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/2OOoMQB.jpg" width="429.16" height="600" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>one where you found lost things and learned karate</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3sXJi0A.jpg" width="433.125" height="600" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a car racing one</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oBv6RuA.jpg" width="437.75" height="600" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a Clone Wars one</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/s7rdYvV.jpg" width="428.22" height="600" />

        which I think was my favorite. I also really liked

        the SpongeBob one,

        which is interesting because we were never allowed to watch SpongeBob and I had no idea who the characters were. SpongeBob blew bubbles and could hang glide from his pants, the tiger guy had claws and could roar really loudly,
        temporarily immobilizing the enemies. Danny Phantom could double jump, which was super cool to me. (I was a bit confused as to why he had white hair, though.)

        The Super Chicks one was also pretty fun. I remember how you entered the main town area through this elevator, and then you kind of just walked around. The only kind of common mission I remember were saving people's cats and returning their
        lost belongings. There was also a karate class place, and I loved training there so I could beat the robbers. Those were rare, and I would spend tons of time trying to find them so I could beat them in a fight.

        I don't remember much about

        <span onmouseover="ontext13()"><u>the car racing one</u>,</span>

        was one of my favorites, maybe because it was most like a normal video game. I do remember that I liked holding down the 'block' button and just letting the droids' own blaster shots hit and kill themselves. One more memory about Didjs - I
        had a sleepover with my cousin Aiden during the 2014 stateside in America. (They were moving around this time, so they had tons of boxes and other stuff in their garage, including this one book called "[Name] the cliffhanger" and it was
        literally about a guy hanging on a cliff.) Anyway, we went swimming in their pool, in which / to the side of which were a few cabbage-looking things. Whatever the case, we ended up touching and being in the same water as those plants. When we
        went back inside, he and I both started itching uncontrollably. It was one of those itches that was in 5 places at once and just moved when you scratched one of those spots. We were playing

        <span onmouseover="ontext15()"><u>Jetpack Hero</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV15" width="600; height:450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo15()" onload="offvideo15()" onmouseout="offvideo15()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vEqKqBpY3zhuE69v0gz3E3FygI0-EWeN" controls></video>

        in his room on their/(our?) Didj, so thats why I remember the itching so well and how it relates to Didjs at all. (In that game, I remember 1, spamming whenever I had multishot so the screen would become a chaotic mess of bolts, and 2, being
        a bit scared of the bad guys, especially those electric ball ones, because I think they were the strongest of the common enemies. I like those little robot guys a bit though, because I thought it was funny when they got electrocuted when
        hit.)

      <br><br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">But enough about games. We're in September 2012. Kesed had his 5th birthday on the 19th, and this was an interesting one. He was going to have a party with his youeryuan classmates, so my mom went all out on his
        cake. Most of the time, our birthday deserts aren't even an actual cake, but this time my mom made one specifically for Kesed and his party with Chinese friends. She spent a ton of time on it, the most of any birthday desert I can remember.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>It had multiple colored layers, green icing, sprinkles, with dinosaur toys (he was going through a dinosaur phase at the time) and a note on top</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v6c6V7e.jpg" width="900"
          height="600" />


        (Since our birthday parties in the past had only been with family and family friends, there wasn't any social drama-type aspect to them.) Anyway, one day Kesed comes home from school and my mom shows him the cake, "Ta da!" He looks at the
        super nice cake, is quiet for a moment, then says in a disappointed voice, "I wanted a circle cake." Long story short, we ate his cake during Family Night while he went to bed early. My mom was not happy. We bring that story up to him to this
        day.

        Moving quickly along, there's a video I found that doesn't fit into the story well, but I thought I would include nonetheless. I think Grampa sent it to us. The fact that I still remember it well shows just how outrageously funny I thought

        <span onmouseover="ontext19()"><u>this video</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV19" width="500; height:375" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo19()" onload="offvideo19()" onmouseout="offvideo19()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Dwa7jB-7FDImFK2fGIfbU9jGqwAXICTI" controls></video>

        was at the time. (It doesn't my case that when I rewatch it now I start laughing all over again.)

        Anyways, around this time the Bensons moved near us. I think we had met them before, but only when we were little. I think they were even one of the people that had sent us care packages. (Here, going from left to right, we have [unknown],
        Enya, Yamma, Seb (Sebastian, a good friend of ours), Mr. Loren [Benson], Charis/Selah/Makaria, me, and Mrs. Cindy [Benson], all in

        So about the Bensons. They were with us all the time. A bunch of times a few of us would go to their houses for sleepovers. (I didn't as often, I don't remember why.) Every time the other kids came back from one of these, they went on and on
        about these bedtime stories Mr. Loren would tell, called 'Flicka stories'. They were all about this flying horse named Flicka that went on adventures with two kids in some fantasy land. I only think I got to hear a few of those, but I do
        remember clearly how much we loved them. The Bensons also had a dachshund named

        Bean.

        Oh, speaking of the Bensons, that reminds me. We were all at their house one time (maybe for church?) when someone put the

        <span onmouseover="ontext20()">"<u>Hide ya kids, hide ya wives</u>"</span>

        video up with the projector. Everyone loved it, but after it finished I asked my dad (?) what a certain sensitive word in that video was, to which he said we'd talk about it later. (We didn't, so I had to look it up in the little Dashboard
        dictionary widget on my parent's computer, so RIP me. Luckily I still didn't understand.) Soon after that, Kesed was doing grammar in homeschool and was learning parts of speech. My mom asked him "Do you know what an adjective is?" and Kesed
        said "Yeah! Adjective, adje-wife, adjective, adje-wife."

        But yeah. That's the first viral music-related video I remember seeing for the first time, but it definitely wasn't the only one that caught on in our family in Fuzhou. We loved the classic China ones,

        but we knew it was a big deal and he had been working towards it for a REALLY long time. My mom had said she would do a cartwheel when my dad finally finished it, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>she did</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KGpc96w.jpg" width="597.531" height="800" />

        much to our enjoyment, right in the middle of the empty concrete square area. To celebrate when he returned from America, we went on a three-part fun day where we went to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this play place</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/TZSDkRO.jpg" width="598.131" height="800" />

        watched Wreck-it Ralph in the theater, and we were gonna get frozen yogurt at a new place, but it was closed for some reason. I was super disappointed that we didn't get to all three and pouted, which I then cried about on the bus home
        because I felt bad for being ungrateful for the super fun day. About Wreck it Ralph, I just remember Selah not liking it just because of that one part where he lies about having a cherry. Soon after this, we did our normal Reformation Day
        things. This time it was about Jonathan Edwards, which is who Kesed gets the middle name Edwards from. We did

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the interviews</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zNMvmFM.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        from the party, the Lees, Yamma, *can't remember her name, but we always joked that she was Kesed's girlfriend, since he always loved being around young asian women*, Charissa (or maybe her sister, who I stared at for a while during church at
        the Funderburk's house because she looked so familiar), and Seb.

        Next came Selah's birthday on November 12th, which we celebrated

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with the Lees and the Herbergers</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lI7ofc8.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        out of a balloon and paper-mâché as always,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>which was super fun</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KyJ6Am3.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        Late November came two things. First, a new couple had moved into the neighborhood,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Emily and Justin Brandt</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MiC7ItH.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        I don't remember too much about them, just that Mrs. Emily might have played guitar and they both lived decently far down the road. One time, about a year after where we are now, when we were at their house, a bunch of us gathered together to
        play Spoons. In one round, me and Mr. Justin both grabbed for the same spoon, and we both tugged super hard at it. He had the wide part in his hand and I had the handle. I ended up getting the spoon, but in the process I actually

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>CUT HIS HAND</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jbYSs42.jpg" width="600" height="900" />

        with the head of the spoon. I was super proud, which I'm guessing is why I asked my mom to take a picture of it.

        The second big thing that happened at this point was Mimi and Auntie Pam (her sister)'s visit. We did tons of things with them.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We introduced them to Lisa and Anais</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cXQDxVk.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        brought them to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this park-ish place nearby</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SvLjoVU.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and of course took lots of

        We also went to a place we saw near the park called

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Modern Toilet</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HCoEihP.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        a place us kids found hilarious and begged our parents to let us visit until they finally agreed

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>to have dessert there</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fzko9Xk.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        (My dad has never been a big fan of toilet humor. I'm not sure he even went with us on this occasion.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>The toy you saw Kesed holding in that first picture</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kqdjlWf.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        was one from a set of toys. I think we only had the yellow guy, though. They were all associated with some fruit, and that one was the pineapple one. If you had the whole set, you could reassemble the pieces into

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>one giant robot</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0fGncA1.jpg" width="591" height="600" />

        We also took the two of them to the main orphanage. I remember one time especially clearly. (I might have been reading Divergent at the time, because I have a memory of sitting against a pillar reading it inside the orphanage while everyone else ate at the table nearby.) I remember one time during a meal there, the topic of Mimi's hair came up. She's always dyed it as long as I can remember, and I like it that way, because that's how I remember her. At one point, they asked me whether I prefered her hair dyed or not dyed, because I think they had been discussing how she might try out not have it dyed for a bit. I answered honestly, saying that I much preferred it dyed. Apparently, I wasn't supposed to be so frank about it, because they all kind of started laughing and later my dad explained that I shouldn't always be so forthright with things, that I sometimes needed to use tact instead of pure candor (pun  intended). So that was interesting. 

Anyways, along with December came my parents' anniversary and Christmas. On the 12th, we did a countdown at lunch to 12:12 PM on 12/12/2012, which was super cool. (Strangely, I think I remember being called into the kitchen that lunch by my
        mom or our Ayi to watch some raw fish twitch in a bowl.) I had personally kept track of when it happened at 11:11 AM on 11/11/2011. At that point we were in an airport of some kind and I was keeping track of the time while trying to find my
        mom in a small shop near the boarding gate to show her. Anyways, we did all our regular Christmas traditions, researching charities,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>putting up our tree and its lights/ornaments</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GEtiDbL.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and other decorations around the house. We have a tradition of getting a new ornament each year, and another one that actually started in Fuzhou. <a id="2013.tag"><u>Apparently</u>,</a> some people in the States put a small cloth bird on top of their Christmas tree. We
        gave it a Chinese twist, and ever since

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we've put a badminton birdie at the top of our tree</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8VZ4Gua.jpg" width="534" height="801" />
        

        And then came 2013! My birthday came on the 13th, as per usual. When I was at the table for breakfast, my dad came up behind me and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sprayed silly string all over me</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0cZpMx1.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        which the rest of my family found hilarious but just confused me because I had no idea what silly string was. I did get excited, though, just from all the energy in the room.

        I received

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>an electric drum set</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KIMVvHV.jpg" width="597.531" height="800" />

        as a gift from my parents. Apparently I had been asking for one for a while, so I was super excited. I remember going to the instrument store to get a couple of extra console/speaker connectors, maybe because I lost the first one. That small
        piece would be super annoying later on, making me have to position the wires <i>just</i> so in order for sound to go through. My hired that guy above to come teach me. He had this thin plastic folder with laminated sheets of drumming drills I
        would do. It had all sorts of cool effects and instrumental song versions I could play along to, one of which I later learned was "Stayin' Alive" by the BeeGees.

        Late January, the Masseys came to visit us.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We celebrated Charis's birthday</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jctrtxU.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        a bit early, possible because of this visit. I think this was their first time to visit us in our home city, so

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we took tons of pictures together</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Cr1iNwU.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        It's around this time that we get the first pictures of the next big volunteer group:

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Amanda</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sSGSGXH.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        and

        <span>'<u>Caleb & Kayla'</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qeyRxjM.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        I put the last two together because they were either married or engaged at this time, and also because Amanda came back on her own a couple times. These three were probably the volunteers that we got the closest to, especially Amanda because
        of her extra visits.

        For Chinese New Years, we,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>along with</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/IadvkD0.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        Amanda, Caleb and Kayla,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>lit a lantern</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lndRB7s.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        in the middle of the night at the empty square. Right after we lit it, though, the wind caught it and flung it into the trees, which were near grass and an apartment building. Luckily, we were able to chase after and retrieve it, so luckily
        it didn't catch anything else on fire.

        <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">In early February 2013, we went on another homeschool conference in Thailand. This is one of the first ones I have distinct memories of. Before this, I only have vague memories. One of those, however, I remember
        had us do this project involving nutrition. We had to log every single thing we ate in this app/website thing, which was really hard when my mom / our Ayi made most of our food at home. We were supposed to compile our findings and assemble a
        presentation on posterboard, which we couldn't find anywhere in China. So, we ended up going with these big, regular paper posters with all our stuff on it, which didn't look nearly as impressive as the few kids who did manage to get
        posterboard. I was kind of embarrassed about it, but at the same time felt bad for my mom, who had spent so much time helping us log our information and looking for the best possible presentation materials. I do remember a few adults coming
        over to look at my tiny paper sitting on the table, probably out of pity. The posterboard kids had those huge standing foldout ones you see in the movies at high school science fairs. We had something in the range of A4 paper.

        Anyways, this time the theme was book characters. We had to design a book-themed cereal box and dress up as a character from our book. I was really getting into Star Wars at this point, so I wanted to be Luke. I reasoned that since there were
        novel adaptions of the Star Wars movies, it counted as a book character. So I packed my mom's long, hooded sweater and a glowstick-filled bubble wand, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was ready to go</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0v1h6Z6.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        Kesed went the same route

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>and picked Spiderman</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/eTo16mc.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        from one of his favorite kid books. (He used this suit that he got for his birthday/Christmas that he would go on to keep wearing well past when it stopped fitting him.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Charis did Fancy Nancy</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HK1v6LD.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and Selah did the girl from Betsie and the Emperor.

        This conference was a BIG ONE. There were the Masseys, the Morellos, the Corellos, the Lees, the Lathams, the Olmsteads, and more that I'm sure I've just forgotten. At the big event thing I think near the beginning, we all

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>went on stage</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LjhMEEe.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and talked about our character. I remember how I had some spiel where I would

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I would always go on explaining</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/23I2i6C.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        why I had a Star Wars character, how it was SPECIFICALLY Luke from Return of the Jedi, and how it counted as a book because it was on the Kindle app on the iPad. I was a bit self conscious about the unofficialness of the outfit and character
        choice, but I was also a bit proud I had found such a good loophole. We then, according to pictures,



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>read our book out loud</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/NRsHk9A.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a group of our peers</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PFNmph1.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        Throughout that week (most conferences I went on were a week, a bit over a week or so,) we did all the usual fun Thailand stuff. We hung out at

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the pool</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4gkMsan.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        a whole bunch. I remember doing chicken fights on the shoulders of some semi-heavy teenager, I think dark asian like Filipino or something, and we were unbeatable. We must have beaten 6 or 7 other pairs of 13-15 year old boys before my guy
        asked for a rest. My knees had been so clamped on his shoulders and neck that even when I fell back into the water I was able to be hauled back up again. We called ourselves 'invincible' or the 'unbeatable team' or something like that. After
        he took a break, I still wanted to keep playing. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone to ride upon. Finally Selah came up and said she could do it for me. I was super happy. Unfortunately, the other pairs beat us pretty easily. I was both
        embarrassed because we had lost so easily and felt really bad for Selah, who had tried so hard and who had come over to help me out when she saw I was alone. It was one of those moments that makes you want to shrivel up inside.

        Anyways, things went on as usual. We took all the standardized tests as per norm, which I always enjoyed. To this day I still enjoy taking standardized tests. I guess I see them as a way to see whether I am objectively better at something
        than everyone else. This conference was I think the first time I recognized that I was ahead of everyone else. One of the days, I was just chilling in the same class as Emily Massey, who is two years older than me. I was a bit disappointed
        about this, because I wanted to be with my age group, both for the fact that they were my age and because Anna was there, who you might remember from the very first paragraph. Anyway, I was in class doing my thing when a teacher pulled me
        into the hall. Then they went inside and talked with my teacher about moving me up a grade. All the kids were peeking around the door to see what I was doing, and I shrugged at them, trying to appear like I didn't know what was really going
        on but inwardly was super pleased that I was moving ahead of even the class that was 2 years ahead. Other memories from the conference... oh, and some of these <i>might</i> be from other conferences from around this time, but they are all
        similar in a way. For some reason, I remember the long line that we got food in at

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this dinner</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OPXwtDg.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        I also remember (and this was at a different conference, I think) going in the small hot tub-kiddie pool thingie with probably 6 or 7 other guys my age and crawling/walking/swimming around in a circle clockwise for 20-30 minutes trying to
        create a whirlpool. Unfortunately, it was connected to the larger swimming pool, which I think is why it didn't work very well. I guess I expected it to work like the water bottle tornado trick I learned in Chinese school.

        But back to the February 2013 conference-specific stuff. I think it was this conference where the Vaughns, the Olmsteads, and maybe the Corellos all played Pictionary in one of the hotel rooms. All I remember about this is that Hudson kept
        guessing 'George Washington!' for every single card, which cracked everyone up. It was at the end of one of these types of nights (playing games and hanging out with other families' kids) in which I had another sorta incident. (It might have been this conference, or maybe one a few years prior.) Nearly everyone had already left. There was this one lady, maybe a cleaning lady? that was in our room. It was pretty late, maybe I was tired, but for whatever reason as she left I yelled out, "BYE, FAT LADY!". I wasn't being mean, I was just describing her most obvious characteristic. Needless to say, my parents hissed "Malachi!" in a shocked whisper. I remember not really knowing what I had done wrong, but semi-pleased to have gotten such a reaction out of everyone. During one of the snack-time sessions, they gave out soft-serve ice cream cones. We were each supposed to only get one each, but there was a constant chaotic
        huddle of groping arms around the person handing them out, so I took advantage of the situation, sneaking arm after arm in and reeling in my catches. By the time the crowd cleared, I had eaten no fewer than 8 full on ice cream cones, which I
        then went on to brag about to my mom, who was busy

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>taking pictures with her friends</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/84lCetg.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        in the room directly inside the entrance to the left. On one of the last days, we finally presented our cereal boxes. I chose my spot with skill, as you can see in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this picture right here</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CsNzjfS.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        This conference was also the spot of a few other memories. I remember going into the cafeteria for the first dinner and asking where all the good stuff was. My mom asked me what I meant, and I told her the bacon, omelets, and cereal, of
        course. So she explained to me that those were breakfast only things and they didn't serve them 24/7. So that was disappointing. I do, however, have specific memories of the exit out the cafeteria. It forked off to the left and right.
        Directly in front was a grassy mound area I'll mention again in a second. I specifically recall seeing beautiful sunsets as I walked out of that cafeteria door. In a field nearby one night, everyone (like 50 kids total) got together and
        played Capture the Flag. This was possibly the first time I had played it, so I wasn't 100% sure what I was doing. I came up with what I thought was an excellent strategy, though. I went up wandering around the enemy's flag, and when the
        guards spotted me, they asked me if I was on their team, to which I casually replied that I had been sent to guard the flag as well. They accepted this and eventually went off, leaving me with the flag alone. I snatched up the flag and went
        back to my original team, telling my teammates of my ingeniousness and winning us the game. I thought I was super clever, but after a bit of confusion, one of the big teenagers announced that there had been a possible
        cheating/misunderstanding of the rules, which had led to an undeserved victory. I was a bit embarrassed, even though he didn't name me specifically, just to the crowd at large. We kept playing (it must have been 9 or 10 at this point, it was
        pitch black) until parents eventually called kids back to go to their rooms. When I rejoined my mom, I almost started crying in disappointment when she told me that there was no more cookie cake (?) left because I had been out playing instead
        of being there.

        That was either very late the last night, one of the next-to-last nights, or from another conference altogether, because I specifically remember the occurrences of February 2013's homeschool conference's last night. All the kids went up onto
        the grassy mound and dance to all sorts of songs played over a giant speaker nearby. I remember it being the first stereotypical 'party dancing' atmosphere I had ever been in, and I was super pumped up,

        <span onmouseover="ontext28()"><u>full on dancing the whole time</u>.</span> (Here I'm in the red shirt going from the mid-left to the far right.)

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV28" width="450" height="800" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo28()" onload="offvideo28()" onmouseout="offvideo28()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mIYclKwf5uTrgNqhEXITaaks0Ukp_2tF" controls></video>

        Of course I tended to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>conveniently gravitate</u> in the direction of certain girls, like Anna or <u>Emma Corollo</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/000RR6f.jpg" width="801" height="534" />



        After a while, I got tired of dancing / the music wasn't any songs I knew like Gangnam Style, so I went around looking for things to do. Someone said they were starting up a football game in the field behind the grassy mound, so I went to
        check it out. After a lot of yelling by the other boys over who would be the quarterback, everyone lined up and we started. Now, I didn't really know football at all. All I knew was that people tackled each other. That's part of the reason
        why I went over to play in the first place. For all I know, they might have been playing touch football, but I had no clue about anything as complicated as that. When the quarterback grunted and threw the ball back, I latched onto the
        yellow-shirted blonde kid in front of me and hauled him to the ground. I then held onto his leg for dear life and held him down until play was over. He yelled at me angrily all the while when I was holding onto him and after the play. I
        didn't know what was going on, I was just proud that I had tackled the person in front of me. (He was lanky and a bit taller than me.) I just told him I was doing my job, to which I think he stormed away. I think after that I went back to
        dancing for a bit until my parents called me to join them to head back home. Apparently, somewhere along the way that night Anna had been dancing when she saw a bee flying towards her. She started to run away off the mound and tripped,
        breaking her arm in the fall. Well that sucked, because us and the Masseys were going to have a vacation together immediately afterwards. I did, however, realize that this was my opportunity to be the supportive hero during her time of need.
        I remember walking back to the room in the dark that last night of the conference, wondering how her broken arm would affect our vacation time. It took a while for me to get all those details, by the way. I just knew that some parents were
        gone somewhere, maybe the hospital, and that something had happened with Anna, which made me worried.
      </p>


      <br><br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">After a few days, we all met back up in Dolphin Bay for our vacation time. I remember the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pool area with a water slide</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MV0VJHw.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and tables/a foosball table to the right, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the beach</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yq8OBhz.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        only 30m away. It kind of sucked, though, that Anna had just broken her arm, because she couldn't get her cast wet in the ocean or the pool. I made sure to spend plenty of time with her outside those areas,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>playing chess</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wb4pgiC.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>finding hermit crabs in the sand along the beach</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8r5w3hS.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        and those sorts of things. When I did go in the pool, I just remember the excitement of going down the actual water slide over and over again, as well as some game we played where we shouted a word

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>as we went down</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ppkbQ9u.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        (I specifically remember I think Selah shouting "Obama!", and everyone laughing.) We also had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this killer whale floatie</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LdI7CXH.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        that was really fun and kinda hard to control with the handles. I think I tried to ride it down the slide, but it was too wide to fit. Now, the ocean was SUPER fun.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>The waves were decent</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rbsZ932.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        so we had tons of fun

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>diving around</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wIl62YN.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        in them. (We could all swim to some extent by this point.)

        I remember one breakfast at the buffet area I talked to my dad about honey, and whether it was healthy. Later on, my dad pointed to the island we were gonna visit that morning, called Monkey Island both because it looked like a monkey from
        far away and because there were tons of monkeys on the island. Soon after,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we grouped onto</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0aBmW5o.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        <span> <u>two separate boats</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9QoAhKs.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        and headed out. The monkeys on the island were super fun.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We gave them</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GXPLf1i.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        those tiny Thai bananas, and the monkeys would

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sit down</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UKNhMHZ.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        in the sand to eat them. We let them climb on /

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>to and from</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dkEfpOQ.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        our

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>heads</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4gOGrNn.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>back</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oiBu6Ak.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        which was really fun.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>They tried to eat Makaria's hair</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/JE4n57E.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        which was super funny. Then, when we were all done, we climbed back into the boats and went back to the resort. In the Vaughns' room, I just remember that there was SpongeBob on the TV, but my parents shut it down pretty quickly. They never
        let us watch SpongeBob, because they said it was brainless and "dumb" humor. Now that I'm a bit older, I have to admit I kind of get what they meant.

        Anyway, after that little excursion we continued doing our normal vacation stuff. We took a truckload of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>family pictures</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Voacaui.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        on the beach, which for some reason me and Kesed had no shirt for. I always remember this as the picture/pictures where I made a signal to my future self, but I can't find one where it's clear. So, some context for that. I knew that these
        were the pictures that were gonna be on photo albums, mugs, refrigerator pictures, etc etc, so I wanted to send a message to my future self. I specifically remember pointing or making some other signal towards Anna, which might be

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one from another trip</u> two years earlier. (Look at my left hand, and how I'm the only one purposefully looking at the camera.)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/bB8Gh3x.jpg" width="1000" height="750" />

        I'm pretty sure I made a couple other signals as well, but I haven't been able to find any other obvious ones.

        is of when the girls got to have their nails done, and when I was either really mad/jealous that they got a special treat of some sort or torn between the boys' fun activity and hanging out with Anna on the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>beach</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Jp2urDS.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        All I know is that that sort of emotion is associated with it.

        On what I think was the last night, both sets of parents let us stay out a bit longer. I think this might have been the first of 'that type of night'. Namely, the nights where everyone stays out late the last night of a
        conference/trip/vacation and the best, deepest, longest lasting conversations take place in a placid, tranquil, peaceful, ambient environment. Those nights hold some of the best memories of my life. On this occasion, the adults sat at the
        table quietly holding their own conversations. The moon was bright and the sky was clear. Us kids talked some, then played chess or did other activities together. Eventually, a few of us gathered the courage to ask the adults for some coins
        so we could play foosball together. I remember hurrying to be with Anna for one team, and I remember carrying us to victory over the two oldest girls (Selah and Gracie), to which I was super proud of, being able to show my skills on full
        display. (I had never really played foosball before then.)

        Then the two oldest girls challenged me to a 1v2. (I think the table had malfunctioned somehow, allowing us to play one more game.) I was a bit hesitant to push my luck, but my bravado won over and I agreed. I actually put up a good fight,
        but they did end up beating me. I was kinda embarrassed to lose in front of Anna, and they might have seen that, because they told me I was really good and almost beat them even though they had 2 players. Soon after that, things wound down
        and we went back to our rooms. The next day, we left Dolphin Bay.

      <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">Before I get back into the regular flow of the timeline, there are two very important people I need to talk about:

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Ayi</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DKpLCqM.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        (our housekeeper) and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>LiHong</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gbb3eTB.jpg" width="800" height="600" />

        (our tutor). We got our Ayi pretty early on, and she stayed with us all up until we moved. She did so much for the house. She would do all the regular housekeeping things, but then she would always go the extra mile. She sewed up torn sheets,
        she cooked us meals, ate with us, and she hung out with us kids ALL the time. She would stay after her scheduled work hours to help my mom around the house, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>watch us kids</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/iTmuZXK.jpg" width="800" height="600"/>

 when my parents were away, and any number of other things.

        A bunch of times, she would take us kids on little trips. These might have been to take care of us while or our parents away, but I think some of them were just because she wanted to. One time, we went to a park and took a walk through it,
        maybe stopping to get snacks or to do some activity. Either here or at a small amusement park place we went to once, I ended up wasting 20 kuai on one of those laser-gun balloon-shooting games. I didn't realize there was a decently short
        timer on it, so I didn't know that it wasn't worth pressing Ayi to let me play it for 20 kuai, despite Selah nudging me to stop. That made me feel bad, because Ayi didn't have a ton of money, and I had wasted it for no reason. Another time,
        we were walking around various places and ended up in this dark empty mall area with a tiny arcade room. Again, I asked Ayi to let me play this car-racing game. Well, after 7 seconds the game ended, which upset me, and I began to argue with
        the owner of the place that such a game should not cost what it did if it was only 7 seconds long. So, yeah, most of the things we did Ayi paid out of her own money, because she was the one who wanted to spend time with us on these
        excursions. Another time, we went to this robot museum place, choosing it from a couple of other options offered to us. I remember waiting on a stone bench-like thing waiting for Ayi to get the tickets. When we went in, it was mostly robot
        statues, (I think even one of Bumblebee on the outside?) some with speakers inside. One of them had a sign saying it could answer questions, so we went ahead and asked it all sorts of questions, but it didn't really work. It turns out it
        could answer like 100 pre-programmed questions. We tried those as well, but it didn't really hear us talking or didn't recognize what we were saying/asking. So those were our little field trips. We did visit her house one time, which made me feel bad because it
        wasn't in great condition compared to what I saw at home. Back at the house, I remember how I loved to crawl into these bedsheets we had, zip myself up in them, and roll around. Now, those zippers were annoying if you wanted to use it as a bedsheet, so Ayi kept sewing it
        up so it would work better. But every time, I would just pull apart the thread so I could zip myself all up inside again.

 One random memory I have involving Ayi has to do with raisins. In Fuzhou, we had green raisins all the time. (The only time I ever had purple/black (Sun-maid) raisins was at Immanuel's house, where it was sort of a rare America delicacy.) The green ones were cheaper and tasted better in large amounts. Well, one time my Ayi told me how raisins had tons of dust and dirt on them, and how it wasn't good to eat too many of them at once because of that. Well, I decided I was going to WASH a bowl of raisins. I filled one up with raisins and water, mixing them all around inside. True enough, there was a decent amount of dust/other stuff that came off the raisins. I then drained all the water and set the raisins out to dry. Unfortunately, wet raisins don't dry very fast, especially when they're inside a shaded, air-conditioned kitchen. They never became fully dry, and I think I eventually threw them away after around a week or so of leaving them out. So yeah. Random story.


 I remember how we would give her Christmas/birthday presents, like the one in that first picture. When we moved to
        Qingdao, we gave our old computer for her to have. So, yeah! That was Ayi.

        At first,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>LiHong was only Selah's teacher</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/udwz5vT.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I think my parents originally hired her to help Selah study for the HSK, a Chinese literacy test for foreigners. Pretty soon, though, she was tutoring Selah, me, AND Charis, helping us maintain our Chinese. She lived in an apartment complex
        nearby. We usually got there through the huge basement network that connected the whole area. On that street, there was this convenience store that was where we went to get snacks or drinks. I remember for some reason I liked a green pea
        flavored one. Selah really liked a white popsicle thing that I still don't know the flavor of. And we ALL loved

        the green and blue lemonade ones with a squirt nozzle on it.

        Anyway, LiHong grew to have a pretty big role in our lives. We all went over to tutor several times a week, though I don't remember how long each session was. We would study for a bit, then play around and chat about life or anything else we
        wanted to, then get back to studying. During what I think was one of our earliest sessions, I showed her

        <span onmouseover="ontext29()"><u>this video</u></span>

        I had seen somewhere, using up a bunch of class time to search for it online. I thought it was the funniest thing ever at the time.

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV29" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo29()" onload="offvideo29()" onmouseout="offvideo29()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Vj1ru5gCIQYMgoCk0OeRdrLKJrT2GMvD" controls></video>

        Once, I remember referring to the population of the earth as 7 billion, except I said it as "7 亿", which is 700 million. Chinese counting is a bit different in that whereas English has a unique name every three digits (thousand, million,
        billion, etc,) in Chinese there are unique names for 10,000 (万) and 100,000,000 (亿), among others, I'm sure. But I thought that the latter actually meant billion, so I argued my case non-stop that the world had 7 亿 people, and she was sure
        that was much too low, and that the actual population was 70 亿. We agreed that we would both bring our sources next time to see who was right. I brought along 4 or 5 atlas/encyclopedia/information books that I was able to find the world
        population figure in, and I showed it to her in triumph. But she took one look at 7,000,000,000 and responded that look, she was correct after all. She then sorted out my confusion, explaining the whole 亿 ≠ billion thing. (That story actually reminds me of another interaction I had with my dad. We were walking to the 东北菜 place, and we were arguing over the names of certain numbers. I said "ten ones is ten, ten tens is one hundred, ten hundreds is one thousand, so ten thousands should be one million, since each new name is ten times the value of the last one. My dad kept saying "No, that would be ten thousand. One million would be one thousand thousands." I was sure I was right, however. "I know it's ten THOUSANDS, but it's CALLED a million." Eventually, my dad gave up, saying I would learn someday. So those are my two embarassing number stories.) As

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our family and LiHong grew closer</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wlwJnMl.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        we met her husband and we started spending more time at her house.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Us kids went over and had lunch with her</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B8lKDsn.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        a whole bunch of times. (She also came over to our house a few times to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cook</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4RYVlWu.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        with my mom and Selah. In that picture you can also see

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Kesed's mohawk</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0R79hv3.jpg" width="600" height="800"/>

        which was an interesting phase.) I'm pretty sure she would also come over to

        <span onmouseover="ontext30()"><u>watch us</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV30" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo30()" onload="offvideo30()" onmouseout="offvideo30()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13ND0DA4qwYl72X2IfJAskdGNowtBCkif" controls></video>

        when my parents were away / on a date. (That video isn't super important in itself, it's just the only video I can find of LiHong. Also - the reason a lot of these home videos don't have sound is because Charis' iPad's microphone was broken.) When relatives visited, 

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we introduced them to LiHong</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/JPQlQMm.jpg"/>

 After all, she was like family to us.
        One time, I'm not sure if it was for birthday or Christmas, but she said she would buy us all one gift. Kesed chose a bow and arrow, which was pretty cool. I don't remember what the girls got, but I chose a remote controlled car, which I had
        been wanting for a while. 

<span>(<u>Here's all of us with our gifts</u>)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7FsxgRh.jpg"/>

I think I had had one a few years before for a short time, but had broken pretty quickly. That car had been a red sports car. This time, I got one that was a yellow jeep. It was super nice, and I remember driving it
        a ton over the next few weeks. Then it became slow or made weird noise when driving. I decided to test my mechanical abilities and started taking it apart at the kitchen table. I remember getting some kind of gel on my hands from inside the
        car, and that after that it wouldn't work at all. Kesed's bow and arrows lasted a long time, though. It might have even made it to Qingdao. But back to LiHong. Now, I remember reading the shortened version of <i>The Little Prince</i> in
        Chinese during some of those tutoring sessions. I remember talking with her about the symbolism of his flower and the deeper meaning behind the story. On a different note, I remember trying to convince her to buy me this cartoon book all
        about the last part of digestion, with facts and statistics and all kinds of things. This she was reluctant to do because she didn't want my parents getting mad that she had gotten me a poop book, but eventually I managed to persuade her, and
        I grinned my way through the whole thing, though I didn't understand some of the heavily translated wording and some of the not-so-clean references it contained. Anyway, LiHong taught the oldest three how to play MahJong, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went over to play</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rg3AFq6.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        pretty often. Charis would be our waitress during or in between rounds. She would be the one to chop the pears and bring them out, or carry the bowl of chestnuts that LiHong always had to bring us some. (We would always shout out "服员！",
        (short form of waiter/waitress) and it became kind of a running gag.) She would always take some along the way, though, so we would always joke that she was a really bad waitress. We all became pretty good at Mahjong, winning a couple of
        times. I think we would sometimes bet 1-5 毛 (Chinese cent coins, equivalent to 1.5-7.4 American cents) to make it interesting. At this point in time, none of us really had jobs, so the only source of income we had was finding spare change along the ground
        or through 红包s every Chinese New Years. I remember one time saving up for months for this solar panel-powered fan hat, which looked like a hugely awesome and futuristic device to me. But when I had finally saved up the 10 kuai ($1.47) to buy
        it, it barely worked and was essentially a ripoff. My parents saw how hard I had worked to save up that money, and they got angry when they saw that it had been wasted, so they compensated me for it and complained to the seller.

        When

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Selah did eventually take the HSK 5</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UYc1uJH.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        the highest normal level (level 6, the actual highest level, involves knowledge of politics and economics, which Selah would have no clue about at age 12,) she got a 5, the highest score. I remember hearing my mom shout super loudly from the
        living room, and running out to find out that Selah had received her score and had just shown Mom.

        There's a video somewhere,

        so I'll see if I can find it.

        All in all, LiHong was one of those semi-parent figures in our lives that we looked up to. She taught us things, she had meals with us, she hung out with us, everything you can imagine for such a close family friend. Either just before or
        right after we moved, I learned from Selah that LiHong was unable to have kids on her own. That made it all the more sad that we had left. She and her husband had struggled a lot with the fact that she couldn't have kids, and the fact that
        she was so close to all of us as kind of a parental role made the move away all the more sad.
      </p>



      <br> <br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">Not much happened in March. Towards the end, we had some gathering thing with Chinese students where I remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>balancing an egg on a spoon</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/57yrtS2.jpg" width="599.025" height="802" />

        Now, a few months before this, I had began running with my dad. He had done them on his own for a while, but he had started bring me along with him. We would always run down the main road, across the street, and around the road on the other
        side. I remember the first time I did a run with him I jumped around on benches and anything else nearby, despite my dad's warnings to conserve my energy. Needless to say after that run I never pulled those kinds of antics again. We ran
        pretty often, either every day or every other day. We had this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>green iPod</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7xQVvk6.jpg" width="270" height="500" />

        I would bring with me to listen to music with. (I remember how that iPod had a few super old games, like Tanks or Pong.) The thing is, there weren't very many songs actually on there. This was still the first time I ever had portable music,
        though, so I didn't really care that much. There were a couple of Beatles songs: 'Revolution', 'Back in the U.S.S.R.', and 'Here Comes the Sun'. Come to think of it, there might have only been those three songs on there. Maybe a few more, I'm
        not sure. But I would always listen to these on loop with the earphones I borrowed for the occasions. I got better and better at running with time. Every time when we looped back around and were close to finishing, we would sprint once we got
        to the entrance to our apartment strip. I have very clear memories of gasping for air and throwing back cup after cup of water before heading into the shower. There was one run where, I have no idea why, but I struggled to no end. I fell WAY
        behind my dad, and I was in a super bad mood the whole time. It was really weird, I'm not sure what happened that day. A couple of the beginning runs were a bit rough, with me complaining that my heartbeat was going "bububububububu" about 4
        beats a second. My dad always replied that if that was true I would be dead, which was correct now that I think about it. Most of the time, though, I kept pace behind him the whole time. Eventually, we began to run longer and longer
        distances, looking to reach that coveted 5K. We were getting closer and closer, until one day ... I remember we were running an especially long distance, and my dad offered to stop it there. I asked him, panting as I ran, how long was left
        until the 5K. He looked at something (watch? phone?) and told me just a 100-150 meters or so. Now at this point I was gassed. I felt I had no energy left in the tank. When I heard how close I was, though, I said, "No. I wanna do the 5K." I
        powered up and sped past him, sprinting all the way to the end of the sidewalk, 100-150 meters away. When my dad reached me, he congratulated me, and as we walked home we talked about my progress. When we did get home my mom congratulated me
        as well, saying it was a big accomplishment. Me achieving this was what would lead me to join my dad and Selah in the Color Run later in 2013. (Selah, my mom, and Amanda were doing this running program together separate from us called Couch
        to 5K, which is why Selah went with us.) One other memory I have involving our runs: One time (or maybe a few times,) when me and my dad would stretch beforehand, I remember talking about how cool/ridiculous the Phineas and Ferb theme song
        was. I have no idea why I did this, but I cringe to this day thinking back to how

        I listed everything

        they did in that theme song.


      </p>
      <br> <br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">I remember reading this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>SAT prep book</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z7LFvhg.jpg" width="599.025" height="802" />

        because I loved the feeling of studying high-school level stuff. I guess I read it because it made me feel smart, because I actually loved the challenge of the harder problems, and because I enjoyed the trivia aspect of knowing information
        that I would never really use after I learned it. (I had no clue what the SAT actually was at this point.) On May 8th, we had Ethiopia Night. My mom made a bunch of traditional Ethiopian food, and we did all sorts of things to get in the
        mood. We put on certain clothes, we put candles up around the house, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the boys banged on our drums</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVjUvvi.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        to greet guests as they came in. (Guests being

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Kina</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/NOe3kxs.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        <span> <u>Amanda</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lAueRik.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        and maybe Lani + Caleb/Kayla.) The kids loved Ethiopia night partly because we were finally allowed to eat with our hands, just like they do in Ethiopia. Us and our mom made a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cookie cake</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hcq2psG.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        that looked like

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Ethiopia's flag</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/mQ5ZW2J.jpg" width="800" height="400" />

        The girls did

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>some kind of dance thing</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1HrGt8W.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        possibly trying to imitate some traditional Ethiopian dance. Several of the older kids then gave presentations about Ethiopia.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I read some facts about it</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/TFIrl3o.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        from my fill-in world atlas-like workbook. So, a bit about that book. It had every country in the world listed, along with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>blanks</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DcAEWNH.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        for their population, GDP, life expectancy, etc. etc. It had a TON of blanks for each of them. I remember trying so hard to fill in the whole thing, researching and entering in information for hours on end for several years, but I never did
        finish it to completion. I have distinct memories of writing line after line of information, my hand getting the gray lead marks every leftie will recognize, and my hand as a whole cramping up from writing for so long. This book, along with
        iPad games like Stack the Countries / Stack the States were huge in enhancing my geography skills. Those two were games where you answered geography questions, and if you got the countries right you got to use them to stack on top of one
        another, each corresponding roughly to its real land proportions (except Russia, which was a lot smaller than it should have been because it would have been OP. This made Canada the biggest country in the game.) to reach the goal line. The
        countries one was more of my expertise, and the states one was Charis's. Eventually, when I got to ISQ, my super detailed knowledge of world geography would become SUPER beneficial in 7th and 8th grade Social Studies with Mr. Barron.

        But back to where we were. Around this time, we were given care of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Hammy</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/A05LN3S.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        the Funderburk's hamster. They must have been out of town or something. I really don't remember much about him, but I do want to show

        <span onmouseover="ontext31()"><u>this video</u></span> 

	(filmed by Amanda) <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV31" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo31()" onload="offvideo31()" onmouseout="offvideo31()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qo_shrACSq4azWrbO6ms2GYg-7Xjqh9Q" controls></video>

        just because. (That's our lazy susan, something that's super common in China. We always joked about it when Mimi came over because her first name is Susan.) I think the Funderburks had a total of 2 hamsters, but I think Tex ate the other one. Speaking of pets, I should talk about our frogs. I remember going over to Chayli as she showed us these three tiny frogs she had caught
        somewhere. She said that they wanted to find someone to take care of them. I thought they were really cool, but I thought no way would my parents let me take care of them. Soon after, though, my parents surprised me! "So we thought these guys
        might need someone to take care of them," they said. I was super excited. We got ahold of a big glass tank to keep them in, in which we put water, sticks, dirt, leaves, and all sorts of natural stuff. Over the next few weeks, I was in charge
        of taking care of them. I fed them by grabbing tiny black ants out of the sandbox with tweezers from our science kit, running back up to our house, and holding them in from of the frogs' faces until they snatched them up. (I did this for each
        of them.) Anyways, at one point we went on a visa run as usual, and I forgot to feed them in the day or two before the trip, leading to a panicked realization in the airport. When we came back, I think two of them had already died, and one
        was barely moving. I quickly rushed to try and feed him, but he wouldn't bite. I sadly put that last frog in the dirt under a bush outside, hoping it would regain its strength and stay alive somehow. I'm not sure what happened to the tank or
        to the other two frogs. My parents decided not to grill me too harshly over being responsible because they saw how upset I was at myself over it. I felt horrible.

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">
        The next significant event took place on May 31st. Namely, our performance

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with Amanda</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/y9DHBN8.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        at some school event. (Maybe Makaria's?)

        <span onmouseover="ontext32()"><u>We sang Amazing Grace in English, then in Chinese</u>.</span>

        in front of a bajillion people

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>while Selah played guitar</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/tGJ86kb.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        I remember practicing the song for weeks/months beforehand. We obviously knew Amazing Grace in English, but the Chinese version took a bit of practice. (We mostly did it at night for our 'sing and pray' song in order to get better at it.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We put on a bunch of nice clothes</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cjJVK59.jpg" width="801" height="534" />

        and the girls put on some makeup. At the event itself, I just remember there being TONS of people, many having those

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>balloon clapper things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/36DahVP.jpg" width="425" height="564" />

        I also remember arguing with Charis/Kesed over who got to hold to phone to take videos of the other performances. (Kesed and Makaria had their regular ones with their Chinese classmates as well).

         For some reason, there is one other memory I link with that performance. In

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the lowered canyon area closest to the stairs</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UwrMNHl.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

         (on the left side in that picture), Charis took

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>葫芦丝</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hfScVnU.jpg" width="800" height="638.2"/>

         lessons. She was the only kid to have a full one. Me and maybe one other kid had a shortened, green ceramic flute things. (I think it's called an 

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Ocarina flute</u>).</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/H5LTtJi.jpg" width="800" height="559.2"/>

 Hers was a lot bigger, and it was made from an actual 葫芦. It even had some seeds inside, which you could hear when you shook it around. But back to the lessons. I would always be the one to bring her, but I also was told to stay in the classroom-shop thing until the hour-or-so classes were over. To pass the time, I would find their bug zapper tennis racket thing, find spiderwebs/cobwebs in the corners of the walls, and electrocute the spiders until they fried. Again, I wasn't a psycho, it just gave me something to do. On a related note, I'll talk a bit about the two other small instruments we had. Like I mentioned, we had those ceramic flute thingies, and I found this tiny paper booklet thing somewhere that taught a few basic songs. I enjoyed playing it a ton. I think we got it during Mimi and Auntie Pam's trip in 2012. The other instrument we had were these 

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>piano things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fwjkmsc.jpg" width="700" height="700"/>

 that used air to play (aka. melodicas). You could either put a mouthpiece on and blow into that, or you could use an accordion tube that came with it. We had two of these, and we played them all the time.

<br> <br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">I've mentioned before that we spent a TON of time with Lisa and Anais, but I haven't really talked about what we actually DID. The most common memory I have is the girls (and sometimes use boys) doing Just Dance with them. We didn't have the actual game, of course, but they would look up recordings of people doing certain songs and 

<span onmouseover="ontext33()"><u>dance along with it</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV33" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo33()" onload="offvideo33()" onmouseout="offvideo33()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gPyoJxzKRK4oilTwI372FOa1H8Y7vfs0" controls></video>

 (They actually 

<span onmouseover="ontext34()"><u>made their own dance</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV34" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo34()" onload="offvideo34()" onmouseout="offvideo34()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=143mbRNSc1us9wrjkbTxapcVF5Ov5vkjT" controls></video>

 for What Does the Fox Say.) And this is where I heard most of the songs I now associate with Fuzhou: Moves Like Jagger, Dynamite, We No Speak Americano, Cotton Eye Joe, What Makes You Beautiful, One Thing, Price Tag, Roar, Firework, Call Me Maybe, Part of Me, ...Baby One More Time, Hot N Cold and Teenage Dream. Basically, One Direction and Katy Perry. The other songs from Fuzhou, like Gangnam Style or Waka Waka / Baby are from either Immanuel or Chinese school. Dynamite is a mix of both, because it was a super common song that we danced to, but I also remember that Immanuel used to sing its Minecraft parody song, "Tnt". (Specifically, I think he kept singing the 'I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes, sayin' ayo' part.) I'm pretty sure I actually heard him sing that before I heard the real song! (He had a couple other Minecraft parody songs, but I don't remember exactly.) So Dynamite is kind of a mix of both. But back to Lisa and Anais. Just Dance is one of the first things to come to mind when I think of Fuzhou, but we did a ton of other things as well. One time, we went over to their house for a birthday. It might have been their baby brother, Antony. Lisa and Anais lived at the top of their apartment building, and had somehow gotten the top two floors to connect, so they had a full two-story apartment at the top of their building. I remember going downstairs while us kids gathered in a group. All of a sudden, this white stuff starts falling from the 2nd floor. For some reason, I thought it was snow at first, but then realized it was shredded paper. A TON of it. Their mom had gotten bag/bucket after bag/bucket of it and dumped it all over us from the upper floor. We treated it like snow for a bit, though, playing around in it. I think that same birthday party, we went outside and all had a water balloon fight, which was one of several we had at their birthday parties, as I remember. We held them in the closed road area that connected to the gate leading into our apartment complex. I remember the excitement of throwing the balloons and the disappointment when they ran out all too fast. (A bit redundant for me to say so, but it's a memory, and thoroughness is the point of this biography.) We made houses in the banyan trees once. I say 'houses' very loosely. It was more of we each claimed different parts of this one huge banyan tree that branched out in all directions, and we went back and forth between our areas. One time, Selah came up with the idea of making bows and arrows out of non-dry sticks and those tiny vines that come out of the banyan trees. They actually worked a bit, shooting sticks that we made notches in with some sharp rocks. One thing we did with Lisa and Anais was tell them Bible stories. I don't think they were Christian, and one day we just started reading them stories from our little kids story Bible. (The story of Noah is always linked with this memory, I'm not sure why.) We went into pretty good detail though, and they had lots of questions about what we were saying. They would also come with us to the playground on the opposite apartment strip, which was an actual playground as opposed to the old people exercise equipment park outside our house. This second playground is where the next story takes place. Somewhere around this time, I was playing at that playground with I think my siblings and maybe Lisa+Anais/Lani+Kina, though I don't remember anyone else specifically besides my siblings. We were playing Cops and Robbers or some other game where we chased each other. I was angry about something, I think that Selah had assigned me to be the one and only robber or something like that, and I had started running away from her as fast as I could, ducking under slides and dodging around plastic stairs. I rounded one corner and ducked underneath this metal bridge going from one area of the playground to another, but I think I came up too quickly, because the top of my head slammed into the metal above me. I remember staggering to the ground as I started to cry. (I don't cry often from pain.) I put my hand up against my head and was horrified when I saw my hand was red. I remember screaming out "IT'S BLEEDING" as I started to panic. The next thing I knew, my dad was there. My siblings had ran and gotten him right after I had hit my head. He knelt by me, held me by the shoulders, and started asking me some questions. I was super confused as to why, but I answered "What is your name", "Where are we right now", "How many fingers am I holding up", "What day is it today" and "What is 3+5" or some other simple addition problems. I'm pretty sure I got them all, with the exception of maybe the date, which I've always had a loose memory of. When I asked my dad why he had asked me all those questions, he answered by telling me that head injuries can sometimes come with concussions, which would indicate a more serious injury and possible a hospital visit. Luckily, though, there was none of that. They brought me home and superglued my head back together. This was the first cut I had had superglued. The ones on my chin and by my eye were both stitches. Charis, Kesed, and Maybe Makaria had all gotten their scars from cuts that were glued together. For some reason I had always taken pride in the fact that mine were sown. Maybe I thought it made me tougher? But yeah. Those are the three scars I have on my head. The only other major one, on my right leg, comes much later, somewhere around 2016-17ish. Going back to Lisa and Anais, there are a few more small things I remember. One time, I went out to find them following one another in a line, walking expressionless, like robots. I had no clue what was going on. I tried to talk to them, but they wouldn't say anything. They trooped around the entrance to Lisa/Anais's apartment complex, pointing to things every so often (things like an antique clay tea set or something like that.) By this point, I had somehow figured out that I had to guess what they were doing, most likely by saying a key word of some type. After what must have been no less than 20-30 minutes of them walking around saying nothing, with frustrated me shouting random words to figure out what was going on, I finally got it. They were acting out that one mind control part in Divergent, which I had recently finished. After that we all considered doing the same thing with a different person and topic, but I don't think we did. They had planned it as a surprise puzzle for me, and once I had gotten what I was supposed to do, I had kind of enjoyed it. Another time, Lisa found a four-leaf-clover 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>in the grassy area</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BaCSV83.jpg" width="801" height="534"/>

 bordering the gate between our apartment complexes. We had began searching for one among the clover fields there for a while, and she found the first and only four-leaf one. I remember that, after much asking, I was allowed to bring it upstairs and show my dad. The leaves were really floppy, but when he and I spread it out on a piece of paper on his desk we could clearly see there were four leaves. I'm not sure what became of that clover. I most likely went down and gave it back to Lisa, and who knows where it went from there. Speaking of plants, there were these tiny ones that you would find every once in a while in Fuzhou that were really cool because the lease closed when you touched them (害羞草). They were pretty rare, though. On the few occasions we went/stopped by/passed a plant store, I would always run and look for some of those plants so I could touch them all.

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">So, we are now in July of 2013. Somewhere around this time, Cooper died. Cooper, you remember, was my grandparents' golden lab. They had owned him as long as I could remember. My grandpa took the hit especially hard. Years later he still couldn't really talk about it. For us kids, it was the first of anything we were close to to die. To this day, Cooper is the only being I have had close contact with who has died. I remember walking to school the day I found out, extremely sad and sort of in shock. I didn't really know how to handle death. I guess I still don't, not really. But anyways, a bit after Cooper had died, my grandparents got a new dog, this time a white/lighter golden lab. I think they asked around for names, and we kids gave plenty of not-so-good ones, but the one they ended up with was 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Rudy</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/U41IBWt.jpg" width="801" height="534"/>

I think he was named after the football movie, because he was the runt of the litter at the time. Besides that, not much else happened that July.

 We had another 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>photo shoot</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/i3eGTXh.jpg" width="801" height="534"/>

 at least for 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>us boys</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BIItr5z.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

(You can see how I had recently lost my front top two teeth. I remember pulling one of them out, and how I was worried because it had turned blue.) That gun that Kesed is holding was the beginning of his spy phase. For the next few years, he was OBSESSED with everything spy. Every birthday, he would get either 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a spy-related item</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/EZjGDq2.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 or a Lego set. (That birthday right there he also got an

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Optimus Prime toy</u>.)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wfi0Mp8.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

He talked with my parents a ton about what secret agents actually did. Mrs. Regina once took him on a 'spy date', where they hid behind cars in the basement, spying on guards / other people going past. But anyways. Another thing we got into around this time was 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>making puzzles</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/tvqo2MA.jpg" width="800" height="600"/>

They were mostly small ones to start with, but we soon made our way into the thousand-piece ones.

On July 31st, we went to a party with a bunch of other families. This included 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>[forgotten name]</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oxh7HiZ.jpg" width="801" height="534"/>

 and her sister, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Charissa</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RyJABxv.jpg" width="801" height="534"/>

 The first one had come a lot earlier, and I have a specific memory of staring a Charissa in church the whole time when she first came, because I couldn't figure out why she looked so familiar. But yeah. I link that party with two things. First, I remember 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>playing some strategy game with an older teenage boy</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pcwhH9Q.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 I think the oldest son of the hosting family. The second one is me playing with a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Bionicle</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LQVHcvJ.jpg" width="800" height="488.312"/>

 toy they had, thinking about the adapted novel I had ready many times at home. They were like these robot things that could each control an element. The red one could control fire, and he was Kesed's favorite. The green one could control air, and he was my favorite. Now that I think about it, this is super similar to Ninjago, in which I think Kesed liked Kai [fire] and I favored Lloyd [all of them, but his color was green]. We did end up getting bits and pieces of these guys, along with one of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the bad guys [Bohrok]</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QLD4WaA.jpg" width="800" height="762.5"/>

 as well (specifically, the red one. These could also turn into 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>balls</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OuvXo5o.jpg" width="800" height="450"/>

) That single book, along with its Bionicle characters, became a HUGE topic between me and Kesed. We chatted on about the different abilities, plot points, and characters ALL the time. Come to think of it, my life has involved a huge number of worlds/universes/character sets involving controlling the elements. One that is rather more well known is Avatar: The Last Airbender. I remember waking up late one weekend and coming out to my mom and two youngest siblings watching it on Amazon with my mom's computer. They said that they had just seen some random TV show that looked kind of cool, so they had started watching a few. I had joined only an episode or two in, so it wasn't too hard to join in. Before too long, though, we were all hooked. We became HUGELY immersed in its universe. We bought several Avatar guidebooks/comic books on Kindle, and I remember looking up different canon air bending positions, then practicing them both in my room and outside. Me and Kesed debated nonstop about which element we would want. He chose fire, I chose air. (Again.) We played elements/Avatar CONSTANTLY. I only just now made the connection, but the Ninjago/Bionicle/Avatar combination made control over the elements a repeating idea in our free time. As for Avatar itself, we only ended up watching up to season 3. I don't remember why, maybe because we moved, or maybe because my mom simply wanted us to watch less TV. Who knows.

<br> <br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">July turned into August. It's here that I found the first pictures of us at the science museum. We went to this place a TON. It had all sorts of cool exhibits that showed off various science tricks or cool machines. One of these, one of the classics when we went there, was this 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>metal ball</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/bdSq07k.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 (It was one of the scheduled presentation ones.) The way it worked was that we all were locked inside, and someone would brush against the metal with this stick holding a metal wire at the end. Sparks and what looked like fire would come off of it where it touched the wire netting, but when you 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>put your hand up to where it was fizzling</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/O9dfDlY.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 it wasn't super hot. That always fascinated us. Other exhibits included: 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a spinning space thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MEWiKot.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 like the one in Rocket Man,

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a hallway</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/b9Zstyu.jpg" width="599.025" height="802"/>

 with spinning psychedelic lights that made you dizzy,

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a car racing game</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ih6mrOr.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 that you controlled by moving your arms around in the air,

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a horse riding game</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/iY2Z6Ds.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 that you actually controlled with the reins,

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a mini crane</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vg7kMLz.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 that you could operate with all the controls that had a hook at the end used to pick up various metal blocks, a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>robot dance show</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/13BCrOe.jpg" width="800" height="450"/>

 a clear pipe with flowing water that held up an unattached faucet (making it look like a floating faucet was pouring out infinite water,) and a full-body version of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3iVhLrm.jpg" width="800" height="504.762"/>

 I loved the science museum, and it further cemented the positive association of science and fun in my mind. Around the turn of the month, my dad went on another one of his trips, during which he happened to see the Masseys. I only mention this trip because I think it was the one where the thing happened afterwards. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We always loved when our dad came home</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LTLaGrr.jpg" width="800" height="450"/>

 but it was an interesting dynamic with us kids. My dad was always the one to be more strict about the rules, so naturally we kids enjoyed being able to get away with more things when it was just our mom. There might have been other things as well, but I don't really remember. All I DO remember, however, is me, Selah, my mom and my dad having a huge long talk at the breakfast table about how some of us acted happier when he was gone. Coming from a rough family/father background, my dad was super concerned and upset. He was determined to figure out why, and to do his best to fix it. I don't remember too much about the actual conversation, but I do remember that I kept trying to leave so I could play with the younger kids, and being stopped because I was "old enough to participate in these conversations." In the end, we got that whole situation all figured out.

 On August 6th, we had a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>paper plane flying contest</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/M5PhhAL.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 between each of us kids 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>along with Lisa and Anais</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UwrMNHl.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 I was pretty confident in my chances, and that's about all I remember. (Here's 

        <span onmouseover="ontext35()"><u>Kesed's self-made video tutorial</u></span>

 on how to make the best paper airplane.)

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV35" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo35()" onload="offvideo35()" onmouseout="offvideo35()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wZr3KESstcT5Wb4mW1vYjoXr5BTE4Vjj" width="480" height="640" controls></video>

Not much else happens for a while.

</p>

<br> <br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">I'll go back now and talk a bit more about Immanuel, specifically him and Minecraft. After playing it every once and a while, me and Kesed became super interested in anything Mindcraft (as I kept mistakenly calling it and getting myself corrected by Immanuel). I wrote a whole series of Minecraft stories, which I'll link to here if I can find them. I incorporated me, Kesed, Immanuel, Aiden, and another Aiden we would meet in Taiwan. (That's later this year.) Naturally, I gave them all elemental powers. This was the first time I had ever enjoyed writing. I used my mom's computer to type them out, and she was pretty willing to let me use it, since I hadn't really liked anything to do with writing in the past. I wrote a whole bunch of them, only stopping a year or so later when I ran out of ideas. Other homeschool things... Oh, yeah. My mom taught us history along with all the other classes, but for some reason she kept focusing on the Greeks and the Romans. We didn't really mind though, and it helped me a lot in 9th grade World History. But yeah. To this day, we joke about how she didn't really teach us anything modern. Even with US history, we mainly studied George Washington (including a bunch of flash games that don't exist anymore - there was a guitar-hero style harpsichord game, a angles/force cannon game, and my favorite, one where you went around Mount Vernon, gathering items and information and learning about George Washington all the while.) and a bit of Abraham Lincoln. (And that was it.) Regarding the US, our math curriculum had a bunch of lessons involving American coins, and that always kind of confused us. We kept having to ask my mom how much each coin was worth, converting that to Yuan in our minds to see how much that would be worth in real life. We would also have issues with out Logic Puzzles. These were something that my parents have ALWAYS seen as an essential part of our learning. We did logic puzzles for the ENTIRETY of our homeschooling life. (One of the main websites we would go for these logic puzzles was <a href="https://logic.puzzlebaron.com" target="blank">puzzlebaron.com</a>.) Well, for a lot of these puzzles, they used American names for the people in the problem. The problem for us was that we could never figure out the genders of the characters simply based on the names, since we weren't familiar with very many American names. Their gender was oftentimes a crucial part of solving the puzzle, so we would ALWAYS have to go to my mom and ask whither such and such was a boy or a girl. So that was interesting. But going back to the Greek thing. My dad had learned ancient Greek as a part of his seminary / PhD work, and he decided to start teaching us some. It does come in handy, especially when studying roots or looking at the original meaning of Scripture passages. That first night, after he had taught us the ancient Greek alphabet, I remember blasting my way through the dishes in

 as I repeated the letters over and over in rhythm. (This was the same kitchen in which I probably broke 2 or 3 French presses) I remember being surprised at how fast I had gotten through it, and telling my dad about how I was glad he had taught me, since I had found a really fast way to do the kitchen. (I think he just nodded, not saying anything.) He started off with all five of us, I think, but pretty soon it was just me and Selah. We did flashcards, practice books, exercise pages, and all sorts of other work to expand our vocabulary all the way up until we moved to Qingdao, so it was definitely a big thing. I remember me and Selah attempting to have a conversation by the Herbergers' apartment complex gate in ancient Greek in front of Lisa/Anais. We felt really cool, since Lisa and Anais were always able to talk to each other in one of their 7 languages, and we wanted to be able to talk to each other in a way where no one else understood us too. It didn't really work as well as we hoped, though. Later, when we were on our stateside, I started creeping ahead of Selah in my ancient Greek. For some reason, I began poring over my flashcards for hours each day, going through a HUGE stack of them each time. As a result, I began to move ahead of even Selah in my abilities. I remember one class time with my dad, where my dad spent a long time talking to Selah (who was crying,) about how she wasn't bad at it, or dumb, and how she was definitely better than most students and even many adults who tried to learn ancient Greek. I just sat in silence for that 20 minutes or so, feeling bad that I had outdone my sister and made her feel bad. Once again, I rebuked myself for showing off my abilities and making others feel insecure about their own abilities.

 While we're on the subject of home life, there's one other thing that came into play. As we were getting older, my mom started helping us be better prepared for American culture. For one Father's Day gift, we all got into the habit of saying our sirs and ma'ams, as well as memorize the lyrics to the American anthem. She also started our social skills classes. These were every Thursday night, and my mom would plan the lessons ahead of time. She would show us videos about things like body language, how to act properly at the table in American culture, and other such things. Along the way, my mom and dad would interject, answering questions or giving their own personal insights into these foreign norms. Aside from the general memory of watching videos and getting things explained to us by our parents, there's not much else I remember about those classes. One time, though, I remember feeling an earthquake. It was a relatively small one, but I just remember how all of us stopped talking at once, looking up at the light. It was rocking back and forth slightly. I remember how weird the ground felt in that moment. It was like wobbly-ish. Only very slightly, though, so it wasn't a huge safety concern or anything. It was just weird-feeling. I've felt a few more tiny earthquakes over the years, but none as strong as that one. After it had ended, we said a few things in low voices, we kids confirming our idea that it was actually an earthquake.

 On August 31st, we got another care package from our grandparents. This one contained something that Grampa had hinted at a week or so earlier. He said that there was something big coming, and that it rhymed with " beltin' ". We couldn't think of anything. We had no CLUE as to what it was. I'm pretty sure we even looked it up in a rhyming dictionary, but we got nothing. When the package finally showed up, there was a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>super detailed model</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Nw9Vq5T.jpg" width="599.025" height="802"/>

 of a ... skeleton. So my Grampa's Boston accent shone through there, I guess. But yeah. We used that skeleton for all sorts of things. I think it was supposed to only be used for homeschool stuff, but we instead used it for puppet shows to entertain one another (usually in the girls' room, as I remember. Another memory in that room - if you'll excuse me for bouncing around - is when my dad woke up Selah one morning and joked like he had caught a moth and put it in her mouth. Turns out, by INSANE coincidence, he had ACTUALLY caught a moth and had really put it into her mouth. I'm not sure if Selah spit it out or accidentally swallowed it, but the fact that a moth flew into my dad's hand right as he was pretending to catch a moth is still crazy to me.) That's about all there is from August.

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Here's</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/O2k2q0F.jpg" width="599.025" height="802"/>

 a picture of an animal-themed kids version of some big board game that we played a lot. That was at the end of August. But yeah, without much further ado, we enter September of 2013. Around this time my mom went to Shanghai to get an operation done. 

<span>(<u>She saw Yao Ming</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/by3Rr3h.jpg"/>

 at Starbucks.) Oh, while we're in a brief pause to major things happening, theres another dynamic going on in family life. I've mentioned before about how we found out pretty early that Makaria was allergic to dairy. Whenever she had it, she felt really sick, wheezed, and got bumps everywhere. Well, over the course of a year and a half or so, or maybe more, she kept having those same symptoms every so often, sometimes for weeks at a time, despite us keeping her far away from dairy at home and at school. She would feel really sick, lay on the couch all day, and not go to school. She sometimes got to watch movies and my mom would sometimes get her gatorades or those squirty drinks in order to get some substance in her. During these times, she would almost completely stop eating, hence why she was always so skinny and causing her to feel more sick in a constantly repeating loop. Once or twice my mom had to threaten her with/warn her about the possibility of going to the hospital for an IV if she didn't start eating. It was that bad. After a long while of this popping up every so often, we finally made the discovery that she was allergic to eggs and shellfish, and everything pretty much cleared up after we eliminated those from our diet. And speaking of our diet, there's a HUGE thing that happened to it around where we are now.

 So, my parents had recently read this book called Wheat Belly. It outlined how wheat has been so engineered to grow faster/resist bugs/taste better that it has become extremely hard for our bodies to digest. The only proper wheat left was in a few preservation sites in the Middle East. In the book, the author described how getting off wheat/gluten had done some crazy things in many many tests. It had even done things like cure someone of diabetes or take away their heart disease. Anyway, my parents decided to try it out. They went without wheat/gluten for a few weeks. They felt AMAZING. They decided that they were going to cut the whole family off of gluten entirely. Us kids were super bummed out at first. We thought that meant we weren't ever gonna have any bread-related products, which wasn't exactly true, as my mom soon became an expert at using non-gluten flours. During the moment of silence in which us kids thought through the implications of the change, I tried to cheer everyone up by saying, "well, at least this means that we won't have to eat some of the gluten things mom makes that we don't like, like those bread rolls that one time." (I wasn't 100% sure what I was referring to, but I did think I recalled not liking an experimental bread roll recipe my mom tried once.) My parents (especially my mom) took that as me trying to complain/make a comment about her cooking, though, and I couldn't really explain why I had said that in the right words, since, as my mom said to me, "[I] like all the stuff [she] cook[ed]." In the following week and a half or so, us kids glutted out on all the remaining wheat products in the kitchen so we could both get rid of them and get one last taste of gluten. From then on, we had ZERO gluten, except on VERY rare occasions or when we were given them at a meal with others or when eating at someone's house. And, although I was pretty skeptical at first, my parents were right. Once you get off of gluten, your entire body just feels AMAZING. You feel faster, leaner, and just CLEANER in general. (The lean part is semi-literal - as a result of your body not being able to process it properly, fat begins to accumulate around your ORGANS instead of your muscles, and THAT kind of fat is impossible to work off with exercise.) So that was a big change in our lives.

 September came to a close. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We all got these jacket sets from people my mom knew</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/a24VV3N.jpg"/>

 (?) that I would wear for YEARS to come. They were all mainly one of the rainbow colors, with both an outside windbreaker and an inside light jacket. They connected to each other via these little click button things on the cuffs as well as other areas. I took the yellow one, of course. I definitely kept mine the longest (I'm talking about up until the 2019 move long), though Selah/Charis's blue one made it pretty far too. Speaking of gifted jackets, I was also given a jacket by Ayi around this time. It was an old one of her husband's. It was always a tiny bit small for me, but it was pretty comfortable, and I wore it all the time up until somewhere around 7th grade at ISQ.

 October rolled around. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>This</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4CloEkK.jpg"/>

 is a picture of a cat coffee shop that I remember my mom laughing to us about. You went in, got coffee, and there were just a bazillion cats everywhere that got pet, took naps, and sat in laps all day long.

 It's somewhere around this time that I find the first pictures relating to our silkworms. A year or two before, we had been learning about silkworms and their place in Chinese history. (Which I found super interesting, by the way.) LiHong had a box full of silkworms that she was raising. One thing led to another, and one day in 2014 we went home with an old shoe box containing 15 or so silkworm eggs. We fed them 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>mulberry leaves</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CW3P0Yj.jpg"/>

and us kids did all the maintenance for them. (Cleaning up 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>their box</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/eQEGvdj.jpg"/>

 changing out old leaves, etc.) I loved to watch them eat, because the way they moved their head up and down nibbling at the leaves fascinated me. They were also really cute. They started off as tiny white things only millimeters wide, but by the time they were ready to spin their cocoons some reached as long as two or three centimeters. (An inch or so for y'all Americans.) The moths were also super cool because we could hold them in our hands without them flying away. They only stayed as moths for a week or so. They would mate facing back to back, and the female ones would become super fat and bloated. Soon they would lay about 10 to 20 eggs all in a bunch, and a few days later they would die. We probably went through 5 or 6 generations of silkworms during the time we raised them. I

SO, with all that out of the way, it's time to get to one of the biggest events of the year, our music video. One day, our landlord comes to my parents and asks if our family can be the actors in a music video he / his friends' company is working on. My parents say yes, we would be glad to do it. The music video was about an American guy who I think was raised in Fuzhou / Guling (where we filmed it.) We actually filmed it at what was his real house back in the late 1800s / early 1900s. From my long hours of research, I think the person in question is William N. Brewster, John Hind, Harry R. Caldwell, William Henry Lacy, or Milton Gardner. Whoever it was, I was him as a kid. (I think he was a TCK missionary who grew up in China, hence the emphasis of his childhood years.) So I was the main character. Charis, Kesed, and Makaria also played roles, and my mom acted in the role of my guy's mom. I remember driving up to the hilltop location on October 19th, where it was windy and a bit chilly. I had to wear 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this old-timey student uniform</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pzDWeTB.jpg"/>

 which really didn't insulate well. I remember 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>getting everything set</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hLW8Azg.jpg"/>

 after leaving the car and realizing that my dad and Selah weren't gonna be in it. I felt kinda bad for them. Anyways, we made our way up to the main filming location, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the old house</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CoQ6Wi8.jpg"/>

 that had housed missionaries for almost a century in years past. We 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ePigEsg.jpg"/>

 had our 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>hair</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6TwPtXJ.jpg"/>

 and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>makeup</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/J1HDkG4.jpg"/>

 done, even the guys, which I found odd and surprising. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>They did their very best</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1AwGNPF.jpg"/>

 to put makeup on Makaria, taking forever in their numerous attempts to make their work visible. Now, side note - for some reason, we brought along 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this little puppet thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XWDw00g.jpg"/>

 my parents called a 'flat Stanley' or something. We kids didn't know what the point of it was, but it had one of their friends' kids' faces on it, and we were supposed to take pictures with it in various places. So that's what we did. I think it was either a good-surprise thing or a raising support for a severe sickness/cancer kind of thing. But who knows. Back to the filming. First, I filmed a scene 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with the other Chinese boy</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XmP6Kof.jpg"/>

 (there was one Chinese boy and one Chinese girl that were major parts of the filming) where we both 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>skipped on one leg</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r7POlUC.jpg"/>

 down a porch area outside the house. (Throughout this whole process, I was FASCINATED with all the fancy filming equipment like the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sliding camera base</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vTNS1p7.jpg"/>

and the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>crane things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AXainoU.jpg"/>

 that looked dangerous but exciting.) I remember having to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>redo that scene</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/99Qm4iS.jpg"/>

 a bunch of times, whether it be due to the lighting, the angle, or the speed at which we were going. Next, there was a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>jump roping scene</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pru76PW.jpg"/>

with 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>both me and Charis</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qn84tsl.jpg"/>

 which we both enjoyed immensely. (I don't remember this specifically, but knowing me, I was probably using 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>that scene</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/mfom7pf.jpg"/>

 as a chance to show off my athleticism to the Chinese girl there.) Next, my mom did 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a scene</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xtrl3iD.jpg"/>

 at 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the piano</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yroT7FK.jpg"/>

 while I think I had lunch. This was one of the first times 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we got to see</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lNvHgJp.jpg"/>

 the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>quality of footage</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/JHjAHtC.jpg"/>

 that was being taken. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was especially intrigued</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7pkGnDd.jpg"/>

 by how they could make it look so cool. Our next scene was filmed a bit farther off into the forest. It was at this 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>SUPER old tree</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hipg5Tj.jpg"/>

 whose branches alone were thicker than several normal trees tied together. Anyway, it took a while for them to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>explain to us</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Z9s5qn3.jpg"/>

what they wanted us to do. Me and the other boy were to climb onto one of the lower branches, and we had to call and gesture down to the other kids to join us up there. Meanwhile, they were to call and gesture up for us to come back down. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>My dad helped me and the other boy up</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CWin1ZI.jpg"/>

 and then we did a bunch of practice sessions. All of a sudden, they said they were finished. I (and I think the other kids) hadn't even realized they had started filming. My dad had to explain to me that 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>they had started filming</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8V8M54z.jpg"/>

 while we were so heavily absorbed in our 'practice' acting / time. After this, we all went to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a clearing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BgYk7VS.jpg"/>

 nearby to film another scene. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>My mom played piano</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Cra9uLi.jpg"/>

 while the kids 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sat in a circle throwing a white ball around</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hsUNtOw.jpg"/>

 (She later told us that she didn't really know how to play the piano. Instead, she was just typing out her name, Carrie, over and over again in a loop while they were filming.) I remember feeling like I wasn't being passed to enough, and I also remember that the ball got 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>thrown out of the circle</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Bg1BeQr.jpg"/>

 a whole bunch of times. Afterwards, we all had kind of a quick break. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>My mom had snacks and water for us</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gIftB3B.jpg"/>

 to the side, and we all rested for a bit. We then all trooped back to the main house. The next scene was with me and the Chinese girl on the edge of one of the windowsills. We were to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sit side by side</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ddujRhB.jpg"/>

 (which I kind of liked,) lightly kicking our feet out as we looked into the forest and blue sky above. I would then point upwards to a specific point they had indicated, and I was to say something out loud as if I was pointing something out to her in the distance. In one of the last scenes of the day, all kids were filmed running out of a smoky room (though the smokiness might have just been for effect.) Whatever the case, I just remember the smoke burning and stinging my throat and eyes super badly They put these small metal pots around the columns of the inside rooms, then lit paper? wood? something else? on fire inside it and let the room fill up completely with smoke. (It was almost enough for my parents not to allow Makaria to participate due to her asthma.) 


The next two scenes happened 18 days later, on November 6th. I don't know why, maybe they thought they needed a few more. They didn't make it into the final cut, though. The two scenes in question are one where I call for help at a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>well</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zFD6upy.jpg"/>

 (I think because someone had fallen in, an idea that kind of scared me - remember my drowning issues.) The other one was me 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>eating Chinese food</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WUIoWHj.jpg"/>

 in a different house nearby - I remember some of the cast / crew 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>taking pictures with me</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RZtknkD.jpg"/>

 I remember that I was really hungry, I remember being kind of cold, and I remember something yellow (Probably the inner/outer layer of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>that jacket combo</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/inNxJvF.jpg"/>

 I told you about a little while back). Oh, and I remember taking a deep look at 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>nature</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/g177yBH.jpg"/>

 on the way there. I wasn't all that happy at first about going an extra day, especially since it was chilly, but I ended up enjoying it nonetheless. SO --- a few more things before I give you the final product: the older man in this video was someone we didn't know. Mr. Loren was given the option to fill that role, but he wasn't able to or didn't want to take it. (The Bensons lived in the same big apartment complex as all of us, so I think that's why they were contacted about this music video as well.) Also, it was after a few months of tense waiting that we not only got to see the final, fully polished version of our efforts, but we learned that the then-governor/other high political officer 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Xi JinPing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LQ2eYL5.jpg"/>

 had seen our music video. This became all the more significant by the fact that this same year he became president of all China, replacing Hu ZhenTao. So yeah! That's the long and short of it. We only have our parts up until the halfway point, so don't feel obliged to watch past the instrumental part unless you want to. So without further ado, 

        <u onmouseover="ontext44()">HERE</u>

 is the final product of all our efforts:

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV44" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo44()" onload="offvideo44()" onmouseout="offvideo44()" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pdUXG1OvapM9Ja8_wWf6CkN6w7AqJUZO/preview"></iframe>

When we first saw it, I remember how we all thought it was super funny the way Charis ran at the end.

<br> <br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">

 With all that done, let's move forward through October 2013. We did our Reformation Day 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>presentations</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GF8w5v4.jpg"/>

 / 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>party</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fCdcqmR.jpg"/>

 on the 27th. I can't find any exact evidence as to who we did this time, but I think it was William Tyndale, because I do remember doing him a super long time ago, and this is our last Reformation Day in Fuzhou. Other things also point to it being him, such as the irregular shape of the papers we used in our 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>"Pin the X on the X" game</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/I5UGZMn.jpg"/>

 (For the William Tyndale one, whenever it was, we did Pin the English words onto the Latin Bible because of his work translating the Bible for common people.) There are two things about the party picture I think I should mention. First, the woman in the blue on the upper left. Her name's Amanda. (To distinguish her from the other Amanda [at that point Amanda Gilbert], we would call her by her full name, Amanda Nelson.) She worked a ton at the main orphanage nearby, especially with Stephen, the kid I hung out with a lot in the early years in Fuzhou. We hung out with her a decent amount, but she wasn't as lively as some of the other volunteers, so she hung out with the adults a higher percent of the time than did many of the other volunteers / local adults. A few months before we moved to Qingdao in August 2014, she took me on this little field trip thing. She had told me a while back about this app where people everywhere would hide these capsules all over the world. She mentioned how there was one in the park near us (the one with the boats going around the small lake and the willow trees on the sides of the path), and how the two of us could go try and find it using the geolocating app. (It had things like clues, pictures, and other things for context, which made it fun.) We walked for a super long time looking for it, and I think we eventually found it nestled in one of the roots of a banyan tree bordering the lake (after initially not being able to find it for a while and nearly giving up, thinking that a cleaning person or something had taken/thrown it away.) We checked out what was inside, which I think included a picture and some papers. We then logged its location/existence in the app and re-hid it, either in the same location or somewhere nearby, taking pictures of the location for future finders. The second thing from that picture of note is the super bright light dominating the area behind the couch. Said couch had two sections: a curved section, and a straight section we called the Cuddle Couch because of its convenience in laying down straight out and, well, cuddling. This couch was pressed into the corner of our living room, and where the curved section met the corner there was a small space in between the curve and the wall. We mostly stored our extra pillows and blankets back there, and oftentimes us kids would lay in there during homeschool or rest time because it was a nice little closed in space not very visible from the outside living room. One day, my parents bought this floodlight thing to brighten up our living room. The plugged it in behind the couch, laid it on top of the pillows and blankets, and had it face up towards the wall so it lit up that corner of the room. It got really hot, and if you touched it you would definitely burn yourself if it had been on for a while. 

And with that, we're done with October 2013! Right out the gate, we have another big event: the Color Run. Me and Selah had been running for a really long time now, and we had both done 5Ks. As sort of a celebration of our hard work, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>my dad took the two of us</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ElCOV4w.jpg"/>

 on a trip to Guangzhou for the 2013 Color Run! Basically, it's a 5K race with 5 checkpoints along the way where they throw colored powder at you, and theres a huge party thing at the end. I think it was a two day trip for us in total. I remember stopping by someone's house right before going to get registered. While I waited in the doorway for us to leave, I had the Weebles wobble song in my head. It was the theme song from a 

        <u onmouseover="ontext50()">trailer</u>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV50" width="320" height="240" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo50()" onload="offvideo50()" onmouseout="offvideo50()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kUlbFj1bEwNdX1RDRw9FDTceOYxnhkSd" controls></video>

 that was at the beginning of one of the DVDs we watched back then, I think. So then we left to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>get registered</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uB0LrIC.jpg"/>

 and got all our merch for the race. Afterwards (because the race was the next day), we 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>went ice skating</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BgzjOcY.jpg"/>

 This was the first time I had EVER gone ice skating, so you can imagine how it went. I fell so often that eventually one of the instructor people just followed me around the rink, waiting to help me up (See picture above). I had SO much fun, though. No matter how many times I fell, I kept trying to go as fast as I could in the skates that worked very similarly to how our roller blades did at home. By the time we were done, both me and Selah had 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>scrapes and bruises</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cafaVlk.jpg"/>

 everywhere. I'm pretty sure the chafe marks on my ankles from not positioning my feet properly were pretty bad, lasted a long time and taking a while to heal.

The next day was the race! We went over to that house again and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>got ready</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zqOzW4s.jpg"/>

 We talked through our game plan beforehand. We weren't going to stress too much about our speed, since it was mainly for fun. There would be water along the way, and we could take a rest or two if needed. (It wasn't.) We would especially take our time while we went through the color stations to maximize our colorfulness. I remember 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>waiting</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DLtW2xy.jpg"/>

 for what must have been at least an hour in a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>huge courtyard area</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pYzgi2u.jpg"/>

 then getting ready to start in a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>HUGE crowd of people</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1q5hGZi.jpg"/>

 to finally

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>start</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RZP2VNc.jpg"/>

We had been given a packet of two of powder to start, and both of us 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>threw that over ourselves</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/LTzqqS0.jpg"/>

 pretty quickly. The rest of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the race</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zLm58ec.jpg"/>

 is kind of a blur. I do remember being excited each time we got to a station, though. You could see them coming up from pretty far away because they were essentially a huge splotch of solid color. There were volunteers there who would throw powder out at us from their buckets/bags, and we slowed down as much as possible when 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went through</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ff7UajN.jpg"/>

 so we could get as much on us as we could. When we finished the whole thing, I actually 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>had less on me</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cbyz1Pc.jpg"/>

 than I had hoped. (Don't worry, my powder craving is satisfied soon enough.) 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>My dad had a ton on him</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/g0ObEve.jpg"/>

 though, I think because he sweated so much. For the next little bit, it seemed like no one knew what to do. It seemed like the event was still going on though, and no one was leaving. We all kind of just shuffled around our areas. I do remember having some sort of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>deep talk/discussion</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7hsd2jN.jpg"/>

 with my dad on the bench thing nearby. After about 15-20 minutes (which I guess was the time it took for all the runners to finish), the grande finale started. Everyone gathered around a stage, where someone went up and started DJing some music, which everyone started dancing to. Things like eye masks (both functional and aesthetic) got around somehow. Every few minutes, a group of ladies/volunteers would walk up on stage and throw out handfuls of colored powder packets into the crowd, who would then usually empty them straight up into the air. You can imagine where this went. Before long, I was going through the strategy of crawling around between people's legs because the air was easier to breath there and so I could find spare powder packets easier and fling them up into the air. All the hustle and bustle, along with the crowded group of bodies, made it pretty hot, and the sweat on my head and body helped more powder to stick. Before too long, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>everyone was CAKED in colored powder</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dkcg84D.jpg"/>

As we went on the subway to go home, I felt like we stuck out so much (as we probably did, as there were only a few groups of people from the Color Run going along the same line as us at that point) because of the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>LAYERS of colored powder</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KLaZLeg.jpg"/>

 stuck to our entire bodies and clothes. So yeah! We went back to that random house again and cleaned ourselves off. (I got griped at at one point because I had shaken out my head, leaving a huge mess of dried powder flakes everywhere.) So that's the Color Run trip. I think it was that same one where the McDonald's thing happened, so I'll tell that now. Me, Selah, and my dad were on a trip together. We were on the way home, but we had a bunch of connecting flights and layovers, so it took most of the day. For breakfast, we ate at the McDonald's near our hotel. For lunch, we looked around for a while at the train station / airport we were at, and the best option ended up being McDonald's AGAIN. That night, we were on the very last leg of our trip, and we needed a place to get some dinner. I cheerily suggested McDonalds, partly just because it was McDonald's (and partly wanting to be able to say I had McDonald's for breakfast lunch and dinner for a day in the future). They must have looked for 45 minutes to an hour for ANYTHING other than McDonald's to eat at. But despite all that, they couldn't find a single good place, and they finally gave in to my repeated suggestion of McDonald's once again. So yeah! While they were kind of grossed out by having McDonald's three times in a row, I thought it was a pretty cool achievement, to say the least. (I had started getting tired of the actual food by that point, though.) After that, life continued as normal. One thing I will mention here - we've always had a TON of peanut butter. Back when my dad was getting his degrees in seminary, we were REALLY poor. We depended on food stamps to eat. In order to get us enough protein, my parents put peanut butter on EVERYTHING. We grew to really like the taste of it and ever since it's been a pretty big part of our diet. Whether it be on top of pancakes, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bagels</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/z4tIjop.jpg"/>

 sweet potato bread, rice cakes, or waffles, peanut butter has been one of our staple foods for as long as I can remember. But back to November. As I mentioned earlier, I went and did some extra filming for the music video on the 6th. On the 12th, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we celebrated</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zgiE7j4.jpg"/>

 Selah's birthday 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with the Bensons</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/U92Mw8d.jpg"/>

 A few days later, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we did</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/x9plGmp.jpg"/>

 her 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>birthday piñata</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/nUxQT1v.jpg"/>

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chayli, the Lees, and the Herbergers</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/m9ecwjF.jpg"/>

LiHong was there as well. In 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this picture</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lt3YFqr.jpg"/>

 of her at bat, you can see me in the background there. I don't remember why. I must have gotten in trouble. I don't know if it was because of this next story, but now's as good a time as ever to put it in. So you remember how we went to two different orphanages in Fuzhou, one disabled and one regular, right? (The regular one a lot more often, though.) Well, one time when we were at the latter, they brought out this 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>ladder ball thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YDARbvG.jpg"/>

for everyone to play. I LOVED the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>ball things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3ehrhXK.jpg"/>

 because they were just like the nunchucks I saw in Ninjago. Well, afterwards when everyone was kind of bustling around, I slipped two of them, one blue and one red, into my inner jacket pocket. I don't know why, it wasn't like I habitually took stuff. We went there so often, I thought I would just play nunchucks with them with Kesed, and return them back in place the next time we went. So yeah, I wasn't really thinking of the orphanage people, more of what I wanted to have fun with. Anyway, a day or two later my parents called me to their room. They said that [forgotten name of head of orphanage] had been 'grilling' all the kids there to see who had stolen the ball things. They also said that Charis had seen them in my bed. My mom asked me, "have you taken any money or anything like that?", to which I was like "no, of course not.", like "what why would you even ask that of course I would never do THAT. THAT's like legit STEALING stealing, not just 'borrowing'." (I had had situations in the past where I had seen a 100 kuai bill on the counter and left it there despite initial urges, knowing what the right thing to do was with respect to money. But yeah. After being confronted, I became regretful pretty quick. I said all I had wanted was for me and Kesed to be able to use them as nunchucks together. After a long time of talking with them, they made me write a note to Mr. [blank] as an apology. (All in Chinese, of course.) I used our Pleco translator app on words I didn't know as I worked in silence to the right of my dad's desk. I included one part that said "please don't look at my family differently because of my actions." That part really cemented in my brain. Along the completely silent walk to the orphanage immediately thereafter, I remember my head just whirling over what had happened. When we got there, I went into the head guy's office and read him my letter. He was very forgiving, and he said he wouldn't look down on my family in any way because of what I had done. He told me if I wanted to play with the nunchuck things I was welcome to come by anytime. My dad asked him if he could give me some tasks to do in return for stealing, and after some pressing Mr. [blank] gave me a grape juice box and sent me to wipe down the dusty cubicles of the computer area on the left side of the bottom floor. Then we went home. Days/weeks/months after that, I remember Kesed starting to say something about what I had done to Lisa/Anais when we were all playing in our house. I remember yelling at him to "not TALK so LOUD!", pushing him against the wall and trying to muffle him with my hand so he couldn't say any more. My dad told me off. I said I was just trying to make him talk quieter, but my dad called my bluff, saying that I just hadn't liked what he had been saying: "Malachi stole from an orphanage one time." (And when put that way it really does makes me look like a horrible person.) So yeah. That might have been why I was sitting to the side at the birthday party.

The day after said party, the 17th, the other kids went and saw 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Anais and Lisa</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VtBh1qP.jpg"/>

 perform at a singing contest. (I must have still been in trouble.) In that picture you can see them singing/dancing along to the Just Dance playthrough for Dynamite. 

I think they either won the whole contest or got one of the next-highest 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>awards</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lilLYFK.jpg"/>

 like 2nd or 3rd. I just remember being angry/bummed out that 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I didn't get to go</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ktmg2iSINpYYAS4RG58EoPu-lfOn-TcC"/>

 (The little kid Selah's holding in that picture is Antony, Anais and Lisa's little brother.)

The next thing that happens is on the 29th. That was the day we had a big 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>potluck</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yfLFe3w.jpg"/>

 at the Bensons' (?) house. Lisa and Anais had 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>helped us</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WcoigPB.jpg"/>

 make 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>apple pies</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3gbs14u.jpg"/>

 to bring along with us. This was the party where I 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cut Justin Brandt's hand</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/svpoAIf.jpg"/>

 with the wide end of a spoon during a game of Spoons (in which I had been playing very well, by the way). And with that, we can wrap up November 2013!

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">Before I continue, I'll give a bit more background info, this time about TV shows. I mentioned before that my parents never let us watch the traditional American TV shows like SpongeBob, Mickey Mouse or Phineas and Ferb at home. There were, however, a few TV shows we were allowed to watch, often ones that were more edifying to the mind, or at least wasn't brainless humor. I've mentioned Avatar, but other TV shows included 

        <u onmouseover="ontext53()">Charlie and Lola</u>

(A wholesome and often educational show where the brother and sister used their imaginations to play together),

(A Chinese TV show about two wolves and a village of goats. The wolf always tries to capture the sheep to please his mean, high-maintenance wife, but the main character (the smart one) always messes up his plans. There was actually a movie or two made from this involving the plant coming out of the old guy's head when confused and 喜羊羊's bell. I remember especially loving this one part where the lazy/hungry one eats through essentially a cliff made of Jello. (I'm pretty sure that's something every kid has dreamed of at some point.)),

 Even when we did watch these, however, my parents made sure to regulate how much time was spent on them. And we watched them all on YouTube or Youku, so live TV-watching like I've heard so many American kids remember wasn't really a thing for my childhood.

 December came by. My parents went off somewhere for their anniversary for a few days / a week, leaving us in the care of Dayu/Enya/a blend of parents from the various families around us. On the 13th, we were on another one of our visa runs to Xiamen when we 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>stumbled across</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DqjS4HS.jpg"/>

 who else but the Lees! We just so happened to book the same boat going the same place at the exact same time, and we met up on the dock leading up to the ferry itself. I remember us telling them about how my mom saw the ferries, namely as dangerous. My mom always told us that if the boat started to sink, she would yell, "take off your pants!!!", and we would have to do so. She said it was because wet pants, especially jeans, make it really hard to swim and keep afloat, and especially with just her and dad and 5 of us kids, she wanted us to be able to last as long as possible in case of an emergency. So yeah.  

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>That visa run</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/R0Bj0Xv.jpg"/>

 was pretty fun, since we got to do it with another family.

 On the 17th, I did a fun 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>activity/crafts thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oXF91et.jpg"/>

 at the main orphanage. I bring this up because 1, I actually remember it slightly, and 2, because it has a picture correlated with it, and 3, because my family did a ton of things like that, and this kind of represents all of them in one. (On a similarly random note, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>here's</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Rb4yLyC.jpg"/>

 a picture of our apartment complex soon after sunset. You see those pyramid things at the top of the buildings? I always wanted to go up there one day. I just kept telling myself "eventually, you'll get up there. You'll be able to see super far and it'll be beautiful." Well, I never did go up there. So that's kinda sad.) But yeah. We move.

 A few days later, Mimi and Grampa came to visit us for Christmas. We did all SORTS of things with them. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Here</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HFKPZHF.jpg"/>

we're showing them the picture books my mom makes each year. We also 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>made jiaozi</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pXYH77F.jpg"/>

 with them.

One thing I definitely remember doing is putting on 

        <u onmouseover="ontext57()">a talent show/contest</u>

 for them with the Lees, Lisa and Anais. (Anais: 0:08; Kesed: 3:06; Selah/Lisa/Makaria: 4:14; Charis: 8:42; Kina: 11:24; Malachi: 14:33)

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV57" width="1280" height="720" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo57()" onload="offvideo57()" onmouseout="offvideo57()" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CX76MiNnwEE6bkSq1QgbIK6PRJDI43ir/preview"></iframe>
<!-- https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1CX76MiNnwEE6bkSq1QgbIK6PRJDI43ir -->

 The song you see me playing to is the second of the two song songs that could play along to on my drum set. (The rest of them were repeating music loops, so playing them wasn't as dynamic as playing those two, which had a definitive beginning, end, and a varying style within.) But yeah. After we did that, my parents somehow got away with awarding ALL of us awards, saying all of us were the winners. Most of the time they didn't do that. In fact, from a very early age my parents made sure to try their hardest in any and all games against us, wanting us to be able to have the full satisfaction of beating them when the time came, as well as the quicker improvement brought about by playing against a more competitive opponent. I guess in this case it was an important enough event, involving enough people, being shown to important enough people (our grandparents) that they didn't want to single one/three participants above the rest. They printed off special 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>certificates</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zWpyuZz.jpg"/>

 for us (much to our enjoyment), and we all took pictures together. Apparently, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chayli and some other girl</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dD4dqr0.jpg"/>

 were there that day, but they didn't do a performance for the show.

 After that, 

        <u onmouseover="ontext58()">we showed Mimi some of our dances</u>.

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV58" width="1280" height="720" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo58()" onload="offvideo58()" onmouseout="offvideo58()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_J1TaO-4UhAVHDcr2LWXDOcgDMQU1_al" controls></video>

 The next day, we took them to the orphanage. We 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>hung out with the kids</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PkzIwbs.jpg"/>

 helped the staff do tasks/chores, and did a bunch of Christmas activities with them (it being December 22nd), like 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>snowman-dressing contests</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ufABUJk.jpg"/>

(that's Grampa on the left) and

<!-- https://imgur.com/85RJaWi -->
<!-- https://imgur.com/dFhK5fE -->

We took a van back. This van is notable because it didn't have any actual seats. I think it was just a 面包车 meant for storage/transport. Whatever the case, 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we sat on chairs</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Nj6n2xh.jpg"/>

 on the way back. (You can 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>also see</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/b28srDt.jpg"/>

 fruit and other goodies we got for Christmas gift bag thingies from the orphanage.)

 The next day, we went to 万达 (the big, fancy mall area a bus ride away from home) for 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dinner</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PW5quaL.jpg"/>

So, a bit about 万达. There were a few things that happened here. There was a McDonalds that was the location of most of our dates with our dad, and the place where I got the talk. (Not gonna say much about that, but I will say that one time when Selah and my mom were talking about something in that area I didn't pay attention to what exactly they were saying but thought it would be funny to slip our 'Human Body' fact book underneath the door to my parents' bathroom where they were. (That's the bathroom where we also had a 

bidet,
<!-- leftovers -->

which us kids used to wash our hands and brush our teeth during the early years.)) Sorry, if it seems like I'm adding random things in its because I have a checklist of random memories to fit into the overall story. Back to 万达. This was where we went whenever we watched movies in the theater in Fuzhou. There's one time I remember especially clearly. It was me, Selah, Charis and my dad, and we took a bus. Charis was being insistent that the song "Shoo fly, don't bother me" actually went "Shoot fly, don't bother me", to which I strongly disagreed. My dad eventually broke it up. That time we were going to see 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Amazing Spiderman 2</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XkR4UW7.jpg"/>

which I absolutely LOVED. (By the way, in case you didn't know, pretty much ALL Chinese movie theaters are in 3D. It's just expected. I almost can't remember a single movie I saw in China that was in 2D. America's super behind in that regard.) So yeah. that was 万达.

On Christmas, we did a bunch of things. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We gave Ayi her gift</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WChukwz.jpg"/>

(The fact that she spent her Christmas with my family shows you how much a part of our family she was). We also did our normal Christmas traditions, this time with Mimi and Grampa in attendance (and therefore a few more gifts than normal too). We did our 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>charity presentations</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wroVETn.jpg"/>

(That thing you see as the coffee table is really an overturned bookshelf that we had extra. That sort of thing was and is super common in our house.)

decorated/had already decorated 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our Christmas tree</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ikd3CxV.jpg"/>

and took pictures as a family both 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with Ayi</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gcreHjX.jpg"/>

 and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with Mimi + Grampa</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HV1vw3h.jpg"/>

 Now, something we did every time Mimi and Grampa came to visit was spend time at their hotel. (It was usually a pretty nice one.) We would alternate which kids (boys or girls) would spend the night there, and sometimes we all would go to the 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pools</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/IR1oy3i.jpg"/>

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>/hot tubs</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/xFphOna.jpg"/>

/saunas

 there every once in a while. This time the memories are especially clear. On the boys' night to spend with Mimi and Grampa at the hotel, I remember wanting to play Star Wars Angry Birds on Grampa's phone, but only being able to do so a bit. On the TV, there was a National Geographic thing about the biggest airport in the world in the UAE. I remember watching in fascination one intense segment where some system went wrong and all the luggage got backed up, clogging up the whole airport. I was super gripped by it, but Grampa told me that these sorts of problems were common for airports, and that it only seemed like a bigger deal because of the way it was put together and partly because it was the "biggest airport in the world." That made me look more closely at the things I watched for ways in which it was trying to unjustifiededly influence my emotions and feelings.

A day or two after Christmas, the McKowns came into town! So now the whole clan was together. 

We

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the cousins</u> </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Itlg9aq.jpg"/>

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our dances</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gZzzKTP.jpg"/>

 (of course) and

 for 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the adults</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/efao7A0.jpg"/>

 One day, we all went to a park area near Mimi and Grampa's hotel. Tons of old people were there 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>exercising</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dfcn5fv.jpg"/>

 (Side note: this is something I've noticed. Not only do Chinese people take better care of their grandparents (when I first heard of American adults kicking their parents out of the house and forcing them into a nursing home, I was shocked and disgusted), but the elderly also take better care of themselves. I've mentioned how most of our 'playgrounds' were actually old-people exercising areas. That's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. Grandparents are also often the ones who take care of the kids when the parents are at work, and the grandmas are often the ones that go and get groceries for the house. Old people are much more respected and have a much more central role to the family in China than in America. Sorry for the tangent, back to the story.) Grampa and another old guy 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>joked</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/O9Jjxtx.jpg"/>

 about

(as well as with

 and we all just 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>had a good time</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XWhV7tz.jpg"/>

Now, you see those walkie talkies in our hands? I think we had just recently gotten them, maybe for Christmas from the grandparents. These had games on them like pong, snake, and other such pixel games. I kind of got hooked on them. I would stay up late at night under my blanket playing them for hours at a time. So yeah, that wasn't great. Another thing about walkie talkies: the previous (and next) stateside, my grandparents had these black walkie talkie sets. They would charge in the laundry room, about 10 of them in total. We (we being us and the McKowns) would play Hide and Seek and other games with them. For Hide and Seek, though, we would often press the alarm button on our own one, which would then sound a loud alarm sound on the people who were hiding. People continued doing that even after it was banned. One time me, Selah, and Aiden were in the backyard playing with the walkie talkies, when suddenly we heard this truck driver or someone similar talk through the radio. We all went quiet and listened in to the faint sound. It was kind of creepy. We tried talking to them, but I don't think they could hear us. My best guess is that the frequencies/channels we were on just so happened to line up and cross over with some trucker radio signal thing. We went and told Grampa, and that's pretty much all I remember about that. Back to the present. Along with playing on the walkie talkies, I also did a few other things during sleepless nights. We had a thick purple blanket that was bigger than any of the others. It was a NICE blanket. Anyway, one thing I discovered was that I could drag my hair along it when I was underneath, and tiny lightning bolts would come out of my hands and nose towards the surface of the blanket. It made me feel kind of like a superhero, like Electro or something. I then discovered that if I held my watch near where the lightning bolts were coming out of the blanket, the watch face light would turn on all by itself. So that was SUPER cool. Oh yeah, about the watch. So, I've never had a watch for very long. Since Jinan, I had always wanted one. I just thought they were super cool. One time, I think I got a yellow one as a birthday gift (I think from Lisa?). I LOVED it. I think this was the one that lit up under the lightning thingies. Anyway, a few weeks after I got it, the band broke off while we were having pizza at a Pizza Hut / Papa Johns. (Now that I think about it, this would have had to have been in Jinan or the early early Qingdao years, because pizza definitely has gluten and we didn't really go to pizza places in the later Fuzhou years.) I think one of the critical pieces needed to put it back together fell through the crack in the seat or something, but whatever the case, I couldn't fix it. That's kind of how it went for the two or three watches I had for a short amount of time during my childhood. Now, back to December 28th, 2013.

 Later that day, we all went to the science museum,  

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>water exhibits</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/luffWmY.jpg"/>

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>metal spark balls</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KgqlFMx.jpg"/>

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>virtual driving</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/bxyePj3.jpg"/>

and all.

 Later we spent more time at Mimi and Grampa's hotel, especially 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the pool</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6k8CgAb.jpg"/>

 and the hot tubs / saunas. (Apparently [the gender-separated] saunas are supposed to be done in the buff, which weirded and excited us 5-10 year olds.) Afterwards, when we had all gotten changed, the guys took a while to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>style our hair</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3Edl6Tv.jpg"/>

 in the locker room. At home, we never really cared about this sort of thing, so it was a new experience, at least for me and Kesed. This is the first time I really recognized how fun it was to comb / style my own hair. (I didn't and don't really like styling other people's hair, though.) You can see how 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>proud I was</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ziVoUwJ.jpg"/>

of my work. So yeah. That was that day. 

The 29th, we all went to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a Starbucks</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Kh74xAg.jpg"/>

 with a big empty space in the back to take family pictures. While waiting for everything to start, I remember two things. First, me and Charis were playing some card game. (Maybe war?) We argued over whether the joker should be included, and whether or not it beat Aces or something like that. The second thing I remember was learning something that had a huge effect on me. A year or two prior, I had asked my parents "what fruit makes you strong?", because I wanted to be buff like all the superheroes. They gave what appeared to me to be a wishy-washy answer at first (well, all fruit makes you strong in some ways, depending on their vitamins, or something like that), but I continued to press them. Eventually, they singled out apples. (Probably just so I would stop asking.) For the next ONE TO TWO YEARS, I ate apples religiously. Even when I really didn't want to, I would force myself to chomp them down, thinking, "this is all for the sake of being strong." Well, it was on that photo shoot day that I mentioned what I had been doing to my parents, and they told me that apples didn't really do anything for your muscles since they didn't have a ton of protein. This completely shook me. I had been eating them NONSTOP for YEARS with one purpose in mind: to get buff. I was super disappointed and was kind of mad at them for 'telling me the wrong thing.' They then explained to me that all fruits made you stronger, and that most likely what they had been thinking was that apples are just one of the fruit that help your body grow in general, albeit not the muscles specifically. So yeah. That was all just while 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>waiting</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DwMIIJ2.jpg"/>

 for the pictures to be taken. There was this group of statues nearby where 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the cousins</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Bx7vdg.jpg"/>

 and 

each of the families

 took pictures. There was also an archway where we took a TON of pictures. We took ones as a 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>nuclear family</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VXob6mM.jpg"/>

 and as 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>couples</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6XvpBxb.jpg"/>

 That was December 29th. (Yes, time warping is apparently now a thing as we're slowing down to a day at a time.) On the 30th, we went to a bunch of places. As we had at this point 8 kids walking around, we went through the city 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>single-file</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lMVquTG.jpg"/>
<!-- 2SFpfV8 -->

 making quite the procession as we went down the street. That night, after having a special treat of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pizza</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/xm7mlKj.jpg"/>

for dinner, we took them to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Modern Toilet</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/nmgNVHI.jpg"/>

where we had 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dessert</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OH1auYG.jpg"/>

 On the 31st, we took them to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Market Street</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1Eyxlpm.jpg"/>

 the place where we went with almost every visitor that came around. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Charis got a haircut</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gWh6TF3.jpg"/>

 bringing her into the state I always remember her as being in when I think of Fuzhou, where she had shortish hair, glasses, and half her teeth missing. (In that picture it doesn't look half bad, but just wait until it hasn't just been washed and combed by professionals.)

 AND WITH THAT, ladies and gentlemen, we are FINISHED with the year 2013. Quite the eventful year, I must say.

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;"><a id="2014.tag">The</a> McKowns flew out early the next day. On January 1st, Mimi and Grampa gave me my birthday gift early, an iPad attachment that functioned as a sort of microscope. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I absolutely LOVED it</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HKr9iXr.jpg"/>

 we had on the Kindle app on our iPads to the small blood sample from one of Grampa's insulin tests. The next day was the last one with our grandparents. We first went to a similar park area as earlier. 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Kesed played Ninja with Mimi</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cXgbBFf.jpg"/>

and later a few of us kids

 on a small hill nearby, after which I alternated between laying in the grass, looking up at the sky, and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>reading from a dinosaur information book</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Qkzb9Y.jpg"/>

 I had brought along with me. That afternoon, we went to the area 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>by the river</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vp0MdhP.jpg"/>

 near our house and did these 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bike-car things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/mfedt22.jpg"/>

 together as a family. I was really sad they were leaving. This is really one of the first times I really got 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>lost in thought</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oxYW2Hl.jpg"/>

 thinking about the transient nature of time and how time in your youth passes quickly, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. That night (or early the next morning), Mimi and Grampa flew back to America. Before we go on though, theres one thing relating to my grandparents that I should mention. We always 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Skyped</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5no6lTu.jpg"/>

 with them every two weeks or so on Saturdays. Here's how it would always work: we would start out just chatting, then 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>each of us kids</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ndp5Tqj.jpg"/>

 would go up and talk about what had happened recently. Then, when we were all done, we would chat for a bit more until each kid started peeling off to do their own thing, until it was just my parents (and later my parents + Selah) talking with them for the last 30-40 minutes or so. We continued these calls all up until we moved out of China in June 2019. But back to the main timeline. At some point before now we had gotten 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this badmitton set</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/u4paTGv.jpg"/>

 with its own net and raquets. We would set it up in the empty square and play for hours, both 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with each other</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/njQLlL8.jpg"/>

 pictures, you can see two Chinese guys that we were really close to. I'm not sure why, I think they were just around a lot and we became friends with them over time. So yeah. Not much else happens until the 13th, when I 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>celebrated</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0H5TTh8.jpg"/>

 my 10th birthday! 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();">(<u>Here's</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RKppEKt.jpg"/>

 one of the birthday pictures with me in that jacket I mentioned that Ayi gave to me a year or so earlier and that I wore ALL THE TIME for the next 2-3 years.) Oh - also: there's something that happened on this birthday that stands out slightly from the rest. So, you know how parents are always joking that their kids aren't allowed to get any older? Well, my parents did that joke a lot. They would always tell us to "stop disobeying" by growing up so fast. In a continuation of that joke, soon after I woke up and everyone was surrounding/congratulating me, my dad pretended to give me spankings for getting "so old". This was completely normal. I think he had even done it once or twice other years. This time, however, he used a bit too much force, so that it actually hurt. Once he realized that, he felt SOOOO bad. He apologized to me over and over. I think part of what made his reaction to accidentally doing that so strong was that his stepdad had hit him and his mom a lot when he was a kid, so that sort of dynamic was kind of seared into his mind. To this day he still remembers how bad he felt that he had accidentally hurt me when he was just meaning to joke around. But yeah. That's just a side story that I remember clearly for obvious reasons. But we move. January goes by quickly.

dinner with Amanda Nelson, you can see the breakfast burritos my mom made/makes all the time and the gluten free donuts she made all on her own on certain occasions. For some reason, that night we all Charis her birthday presents 4 days early:

 that I don't know the name of. Maybe a pogo ball? But yeah.

 It was around this time that my parents started the talks about moving. Stuff with our company and other circumstances pointed to Qingdao as a likely candidate. I remember my mom calling me into their room to talk it over with me. She told me we would be going to an international school, which made me excited. (I had never been to a school with english speaking kids up to this point.) Right as she told me though, I also started to cry almost immediately. I told her that yes, I did think moving was the right thing, but it would just take me some time to "say goodbye ... to all my friends." From then on, we started yet another transition process, not only practically but socially and emotionally. We wouldn't actually move until August, though, so there is still plenty to come from our time in Fuzhou. On the 30th of January, we had 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a meal with our landlord</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QNE3kWk.jpg"/>

 who we had a really good relationship with. That meal is a reference point for me, because I remember still being in shock at hearing the news that we would be moving. That lunch also reminds me of a few other meals we had with pseudo-random Chinese people we had through the years. I remember one in particular as a completely isolated incident. It happened super early on, though, maybe in Jinan or early early Fuzhou. I had heard some of the adults say "干杯" as they clinked their cups of beer together, so I started doing it with the orange juice. I would fill my cup to the brim and start a 干杯 by raising it up in the table, merrily saying the phrase as everyone else joined in, to much laughter. I would then down the orange juice like it was a shot, though I'm not sure I even knew what a shot was at the time. But yeah. Everyone seemed to think it was funny, so I did it a bunch of times. But back to January 2014.

 We spent Chinese New Year (January 31st that year) with LiHong and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>叔叔</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sn0cWIe.jpg"/>

 her husband. We went over to their house to 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>have dinner</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/oruSbXP.jpg"/>

 then we all went out and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>did fireworks</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CBt1r3q.jpg"/>

 together. 

        <span onmouseover="ontext63()"><u>We had a whole lot of fun</u>,</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV63" width="608" height="1080" onload="offvideo63()" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo63()" onmouseout="offvideo63()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1F393DFHinDbG0UMzTCoEzauSqecIBcO4" controls></video>

 Now, I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but China is a BEAST when it comes to fireworks. Nonstop 24/7 booming is all you hear for a solid week before and after Chinese New Years, with more sporadic bursts a few weeks past that. We had a whole lot of fun. And they're always super big, too. Look at 

        <span onmouseover="ontext62()"><u>this video</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV62" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo62()" onmouseover="scroll123(); onvideo62()" onmouseout="offvideo62()" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19RawyNN8yhDomC64PmAYlERrn33djOtD" controls></video>

 of the big ones exploding 20 meters or less away from residential buildings. Oh, yeah. And those are by random people too, not the apartment complex company or something. Compared to China during Chinese New Years, American fireworks are PITIFUL. The teeny tiny ones families set off in their backyards in the US are NOTHING compared to 

        <span onmouseover="ontext64()"><u>the unrelenting cannonfire of Chinese fireworks</u>.</span>

[That's the two minutes after midnight on the Eve of Chinese New Year's Eve 2014.] And with that, we can wrap up the first month of 2014!

 February 1st was 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Charis's 8th birthday</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/p29pTe5.jpg"/>

 In the next two weeks or so, there was this collection of 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>inflatable figures</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Jc8filB.jpg"/>

 and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>fighting scenes</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XF_jpOtV9nNzMkmER5RsxY0Koy6BsV0X"/>

 set up outside our apartment complex along the riverside. We took a bunch of pictures near them, both 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the smaller ones</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12BSBFfYtPO-H2B6tvffzS3guMEKX6o-o"/>

 near our complex and 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the huge horse ones</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1P8JXXfTKRrIc8a3-VwYQL-TfvuZO1OJ1"/>

 farther out. This is another memory tinged with what I call the "doomsday" filter. It's permanantly attached to every memory after learning we're moving to a new city, and its basically a deep sadness of looking at all I've held dear about my current city and knowing it'll all be gone soon. It's one of the reasons why all memories after the 'doomsday' event (finding out about the move) are especially vivid to me. Normally, I only remember memories that have strong emotions attached to them and forget most of the rest. For these memories, though, almost EVERY memory has extreme emotion as I deal with the idea of moving. So, yeah. That feeling of sad dread and doom is present in every memory from now until we move in August.

 On the 14th of February, we went on our 10ish day trip to Taiwan by airplane. Side note - Guangzhou was our bad luck city as far as plane flights went. It seemed like every time we went through there, our flight 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>got delayed</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cMKUre7.jpg"/>

 by several hours, or something else equally bad would happen that would clog up our plans. I bring that up because on this trip 

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our flight was delayed</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HoKDO9I.jpg"/>

 (I'm not sure if we were in Guangzhou when it got delayed this time, though.)
