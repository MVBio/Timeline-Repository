int, and we were in America for a short period of time (but we were living in Qinhuangdao). Apparently, my mom and dad had left my last stuffed animal (a gorilla) behind. We were on some long car ride at the time, and when my parents realized they panicked and quickly drove to a nearby store to get another one. I remember choosing between him and a Curious George stuffed animal, and that I chose Pablo because he had more soft parts, as opposed to stiff velvety parts. Pablo has always held temperatures and smells really well, and I've slept with him as long as I can remember. I still do. When I was in Fuzhou, I tried to get out of punishments with him. My parents would ask, "what do you think is an appropriate consequence for what you did?" And I would say, "make me not sleep with Pablo," and I would act really sad. Although I didn't like sleeping without him, I used it to get out of even worse punishments, like spankings. Another early memory was going on an elephant ride with my family in Thailand. <button onclick="getCookie2(); showCook();" style="background-color: red;">

The smell of elephants is super distinctive, and I’ve smelled it a ton since I’ve gone to lots of elephant places in Thailand before, but it's always funny to smell something and say out loud “that smells like elephants.” I guess not many people expect me to know what that smells like. I learned how to read when I was 2, and around the same time I stopped taking naps. One more memory I have that isn't attached to a Chinese city in particular was on one of our trips to Thailand.
