 a TV show I loved as a kid. I was 2 years old at this point, and we were in America for a short period of time. (But we were living in Qinhuangdao.) Apparently, my mom and dad had left my last stuffed animal (a gorilla) behind on accident. We were on some
        long car ride at the time, and when my parents realized they panicked and quickly drove to a nearby store to get another one. I remember choosing between him and a Curious George stuffed animal, and that I chose Pablo because he had more soft
        parts, as opposed to stiff velvety sewn-together parts. Pablo has always held temperatures and smells really well, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I've slept with him as long as I can remember</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AGqUpqv.jpg" width="534" height="800" />

        I still do. When I was in Fuzhou, I tried to get out of punishments with him. My parents would ask, "what do you think is an appropriate consequence for what you did?" And I would say, "make me not sleep with Pablo," and I would act really
        sad. Although I didn't like sleeping without him, I used it to get out of even worse punishments, like spankings. Another early memory was going on an elephant ride with my family in Thailand. Kesed was constantly crying, so I think he and my
        mom stayed behind while the rest of us

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>rode the elephants</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/86iULTo.jpg" width="750" height="500" />

        Charis might have stayed with her because she was afraid of the elephants, I'm not sure. The smell of elephants is super distinctive, and I’ve smelled it a ton since I’ve gone to lots of elephant places in Thailand before, but it's always
        funny to smell something and say out loud “that smells like elephants.” I guess not many people expect me to know what that smells like. I learned how to read when I was 2, and around the same time I stopped taking naps. One more memory I
        have that isn't attached to a Chinese city in particular was on one of our trips to Thailand. We were at the zoo with the Masseys, super close family friends of ours who lived in China all up until 2015. Now as far back as I can remember of
        this time, me and their youngest daughter, Anna,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>had kind of a thing for each other</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HOzULGm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        At one point during the visit to the zoo, I must have done something wrong, and she stormed off. I panicked and chased after her, begging her to 'be my girlfriend' again. This is when I was about 6 by the way. I had already known her for a long time, though, maybe since age
        2? Anyway, she was the main girl I thought about from the age of 3 to about 9. Until the early Fuzhou years, our family used

 EVERYWHERE. Before this, when it was basically just Selah and I, we had a single one, but once the other kids started rolling around we upgraded to the double, and that's the one I remember more. Also: our family has a lot of traditions. I mention a bunch of them throughout this biography, but there are a couple that aren't linked to any events in
        particular. Every night, as we are giving hugs and kisses goodnight, my parents (usually my dad) asks the boys, "What are you gonna be when you grow up?" and we respond "A good husband, a good dad, to the glory of God." He asks the girls "Who
        are you gonna marry?" and they say "A boy that loves Jesus, has a job, and you have to like him." We also do devos (devotionals) every morning after breakfast, or in recent years after breakfast on school mornings. We do things like go
        through a book, focus on a theme, and that's what gives us our general topic. We all get out our Bibles and read our parts, and then our dad (or, more recently, my mom) will guide us through the discussion. In this way, I've always been much more

 I was to be baptized in 2010.) One thing that was kind of funny in our Fuzhou years had to do with praying. We were supposed to keep our eyes closed, but some of us didn't like to do it that often, especially the younger kids. Well, us older kids knew about this, but we couldn't tell on them without inadvertently giving away that our eyes had been open as well. So we came up with the strategy where we would tell my mom and dad that so-and-so had their eyes open, and when asked why OUR eyes were open to see that, give the excuse that we were just wiping the sleep out of our eyes, which you HAD to have your eyes open for. So sometimes during prayer we would rub our eyes for the sole purpose of spying on the other kids and seeing if they weren't closing their eyes like they were supposed to. So that's just a funny tidbit that happened in Fuzhou. Throughout our many trips to Thailand, one thing we did several times was go to these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>fish spas</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/F7USN97.jpg" width="599.025" height="802" />

        We would put our feet/hands/entire body in these tanks with tiny fish, and those fish would nibble away at our dead skin. It was super ticklish, and from then on every time I was in Thailand and I saw a public fishbowl thing I would stick my
        hand in to see if it was the nibbley ones. Speaking of Thailand, for a longggg time, 13 years at least, my favorite color was yellow. I would always tell people about how the king of Thailand's favorite color was also yellow, which was true.
        In Thailand, at least while that king was on the throne, yellow was a special color. Obviously, he wore it in all

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>his pictures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/979s4eS.jpg" />

        There might even have been restrictions on wearing yellow clothes, or maybe I'm thinking about how everyone is supposed to wear yellow on the king's birthday. Either way, I loved the color yellow for a long time. It's why I always loved the
        yellow

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>2008 Beijing Olympics mascot</u>/doll</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8xUKw3u.jpg" width="1200" height="397" />

        the most. I say doll because at one point someone gave us a box of all 5 in doll form, which us kids divided amongst us. I got yellow, Selah got blue (always her favorite color), Kesed got red (his favorite color for a long time, eventually
        going back and forth with green), Charis got green, and Makaria got black. Since 2016 or 2017 (age 12 or 13), my favorite color has been orange, not bright orange but

        though in the last few months yellow has started to close the gap again. <button onclick="var milk = 1; timechungus();" style="background-color: red;">

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">I don’t remember a ton about Qinhuangdao. 80 days after we moved there, we flew back to Boston so my mom could give birth to Charis. My dad was studying at Gordon Conwell at this point. During this time,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got stitches on my chin</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fqje5hm.jpg"/>

        for <i>pretending to sleep-RUN</i> and hitting my chin on the concrete steps leading into our apartment. The second thing I remember is this time when I got stung by a wasp. The way I remember it, I went over this hill, maybe to get a ball
        that had rolled off or something. I then stopped and saw an old car that was basically a giant wasp's nest. Next thing I knew, I was being stung left and right as I ran back to the rest of the group. My parents told me it was a small nest in
        the seat of an abandoned car and that I was only stung by one of them. I think it was in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this parking lot</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/IP7KIsB.jpg"/>

        right. During this trip to America, the only other memory I have that's not been mentioned is one of

 and we would have until the end of the song to clean the room. Two things that were used to teach us kids the basics were <a href="https://www.starfall.com/h/" target="blank">Starfall</a>, a website that taught the alphabet/stories/etc, and
        this pink plastic duck that we used for potty-training. (I'm pretty sure all of us except for Makaria went through our potty-training phase in Qinhuangdao. When my parents first told me I would be sharing a bed with Kesed, I complained, saying that he always peed the bed. After Qinhuangdao, though, we would get our bunk beds, the ones that we would use all the way up until the move to America 9 years later.) The only toys I remember playing with

        <span> <u>were these wooden train tracks and trains from Thomas the Tank Engine</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QcKLCeJ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I can remember the basic layout of our apartment complex, but that’s about it. Apparently there was one of those static fountain areas nearby, and at one point I pushed a girl into it even though it was dry. I remember we had one friend, a
        Chinese girl around Selah’s age, but that was about it. My parents had a bunch of adult Chinese friends, though.

        the earliest such group that I remember. I still recognize a lot of their faces. I remember that during our time with them we dubbed ourselves "the water team." One of the locations I link with this time period was a coffee shop we went
        to often. It had tons of books and was very brown. There was a song that always played over the speakers,

        "<u class="selector" onmouseover="revealX(this);">Ya Birthday</u>".

        All I knew to type into Google was the only line I remembered: "it's mine, it's yours, it's everybody's birthday." We called that the birthday song for a while. Two things that are always linked to that time period were these pens that had these
        Bible tracts that rolled out of the sides, as well as this coffeecake my mom always made. I remember jabbering on about water on the way to the train station, and how that was one of the first times I was sad about someone leaving. One night around this time, I woke up covered from head to toe in mosquito bites. I went to my parents’ room and knocked on their door, and
        when they saw me they at first thought I had chicken pox! The next day they tried to hunt down the mosquitoes, but they couldn’t find very many. Eventually, DaYu found and killed one mosquito that was triple the size of a normal mosquito.
        After that, I didn’t have any major issues with mosquito bites. I remember one time where apparently some people came and handed us some pamphlets. My parents explained to us that they were from a cult, but at the time I thought they had said
        colt, like a donkey. I guess I had recently learned about the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a colt around that time. I had these

        <a id="2008link">Qinhuangdao</a> was near the place where the Great Wall meets the ocean, so

        we went to both pretty often.

        At one point, I went through a phase where I was super polite to girls, saying “ladies first” everywhere. (This is paralleled later on in Fuzhou, when I remember thinking through how I needed to dock 10 or so years off my estimate when guess these ladies' names out loud in a big group of people at some party thing. They had asked me to guess their ages, and I somehow had the sense to guess on the young side. I think I even told a few of them about my strategy, which made them laugh and voice their approval of my apparent wisdom.)

        <u class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);">I loved to dance</u>,

 not in a specific styles or using precise moves, but just the way I felt like it. This attitude remains with me to this day. In all of my high school events involving free dancing, I always went all in, something that always got a lot of attention, since many at my school were too timid to do much more than stand to the side. My parents told me this next story. One time, I took a liking to the phrase “you want a piece of me.” Maybe I heard it from a TV show or
        something. Anyway, I asked DaYu how to say that in Chinese. She gave me the literal translation, “你要我的一块么?" (literally, "Do you want a piece of me?” The next time we went to this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>hot pot place</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/clpVgEY.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        (which I think had trains going around the restaurant with plates of food on top), I asked the waitress “you wanna piece of me?” in Chinese. I must not have worded it right, but the exact way I said it actually meant “you wanna hook up?” in
        Chinese. (Keep in mind this is when I was 5 or 6.) Apparently, the waitress’s face turned really pale and DaYu had to explain to her what I actually meant. Another hot pot-type restaurant place we went to a few times had the stereotypical
        Chinese animal-organ dishes. I had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>chicken hearts</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vmV5Sbu.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

        as well as pieces of cow/pig organs. One thing I remember about Qinhuangdao was that we planted cucumber seeds in the ground right in front of our apartment. I’ve wondered if those have grown every once in a while. At

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>my youeryuan</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SEgBscj.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I did a couple of things that stick out in my memory. The first is that every time my class would go out in the morning for the morning dance (I remember that one song was about "the genie and the lamp,) I would go and hide in the little
        plastic house that was on the playground. I did this for a super long time, until eventually they told me I had to get out and participate. I would always peek out at them from inside the musky plastic play house, feeling super stealthy. The
        second thing I remember doing at that school was singing Happy Birthday in English for my entire kindergarten. I remember being really nervous, but I went on stage and sang my heart out.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I had many performances where I wore makeup</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v1PNPfu.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        including one where I was dressed in what was essentially a plastic bag, equipped with a plastic bowl and a shower cap. Needless to say

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was not pleased</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/D95FQkE.jpg"/>

        When we had to wash our hands before and after meals / using the bathroom, I would soap up my hands, squeeze them together, open them while keeping my fingertips attached, then try to blow bubbles out of each of the finger holes. Across the
        street from the youeryuan, at least in my memory, was our house church. There was one girl there that was named

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>Hannah</u>.</span>

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV51" width="600" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ix0Et1rZzkt0rdMuyVD_v4VlBkr9E1a0/preview"></iframe>

 I think she was a bit older than me. The only reason I remember her is because I was fascinated by how you can spell
        Hannah forwards and backwards. One thing that always associates itself with Hannah and my youeryuan is this toy we had. It was shaped like a clock, and it had a nose that you could press in the middle. It could also play a few songs, like Ba
        ba black sheep and pop goes the weasel (which I remember especially clearly). I can remember watching a few TV shows/movies in the early days.

-->

        They were pink and flower-shaped, and they had this tiny high pitched speaker in the center that would play the birthday song on loop. Every time, it would be a new experiment on how to turn it off. There was no one/off switch. It just
        started playing once you lit the middle section and the whole thing opened up. We tried burning it, smashing it with a hammer, freezing it, dropping it from the top of a building, and letting it sit outside for several days. None of it
        worked, and we always had to just throw it away while it was still playing the song. Eventually, we did figure out how to turn it off. We had to dissect it and cut a certain wire far inside. Sometime while we were living in Qinhuangdao, me
        and Selah were playing that keep-the-balloon-off-the-floor game, when suddenly Selah hits it towards the big potted plant we had nearby. As it approached the floor, I knew I had to stop it at all costs. So I dived forward... and gashed the side of
        my eye. Yeah,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I had to get stitches for that one</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W86crVf.jpg" />

        On both my chin stitches and my eye stitches, I wasn't given anesthesia/numbing medicine. I'm not sure why for the first one (and my family says they actually did), but it was too close to my eye for the second one for sure. My dad had to
        hold me down.

        Qinhuangdao was also where we got Makaria. My parents went to Ethiopia for about two weeks, and during this time Dayu stayed in our house and took care of us. The plan was for my parents to come back with Makaria, and then we would move to
        Jinan a few days later. Her visa had some issues, though, so they were delayed. My dad came back by himself to move us kids and all our stuff to Jinan, taking a train ride with 4 kids aged 2-8 across the country, in addition to all the stuff
        we owned. My mom later came with Makaria to meet us in Jinan. The morning after she got back,

        Before we saw her, my parents established that we wouldn't be making comments about her skin color or anything else like that. I remember agreeing with them, explaining to the other kids not to make offhanded comments like "take a bath"
        or "you have mud on you." Looking back, it sounds really bad, but keep in mind that this was the first time I had actually interacted with (or really seen at all) a black person, because China has very few of them in general, not to mention
        that Qinhuangdao was the most rural of all the cities I would live in (Donkey carts were still commonly used for transportation, if that gives any reference) and thus had a less diverse population than the rest of China. My parents brought
        back a few other things they bought in the markets in Ethiopia. They got these dolls for the girls, drums for the boys (mine's bigger and makes a deeper sound), and

 Soon after we adopted her, we saw that she was getting sick way too often. We ended up finding out she was allergic to dairy, and that was what was causing all the problems. (Years later, we would find out that she was also allergic to eggs and shellfish.)

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">We were only in Jinan for about a year, but I remember a decent amount about it. Driving into Jinan, I remember seeing lots of cranes and construction sites in general. Before we had an official apartment, I think

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we stayed with the Morellos</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHGMnJX.jpg"/>

        or at least went over to their house a lot. I remember going into the boys’ room and playing with some

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>glowy peg board things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dgTFYc1.jpg"/>

        The only neighbors we knew were this black mom and her daughter, whose name was Livi.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We went to her birthday party</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/riaA70E.jpg"/>

        once. All I remember of that was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>some cringey dancing to fast music on my part</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0D0JUp1.jpg"/>

        One thing I definitely remember from Jinan was always trying to sneak

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sugar chunk things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hQUiBQn.jpg"/>

        into our shopping cart. Me and Charis (Selah claims this was her, not Charis) would go along with our Ayi and try to put the sugar crystals at the very front of the grocery pile so the cashier person would scan them before our Ayi had a
        chance to take them off. I think our apartment complex was raised up, and escalators took us down to the normal ground level. Below the main escalator was a Walmart. I remember how

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the sky was gray almost every day of the year</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HPbuEb9.jpg"/>

         One of the only landmarks I remember from Jinan is

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this old German church</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HB6inGJ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We never went there, and I'm not even sure we went inside, but it was cool nonetheless. Around the same time, as we did the usual explore-the-new-city routine, we had this game where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we tried to find letters of the alphabet around us</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jqDck3q.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

 which was the height of a special treat.

In the winter,

        but my parents said it was fake snow. I think at the time I thought they meant that it wasn’t actually snow but finely shredded paper or something. We did make an igloo out of it once in

 had a huge emotional impact on me. A bit
        after this, a couple was at our house talking to my mom and dad. For some reason, my parents let us kids make some bread for them to try. We had never done this kind of thing before, and we weren't following a recipe either. We basically just
        threw things together as we saw fit. When it came out of the oven, I remember it being being really dry and not good to eat. My parents acted nice about it though, and my mom explained to us that we had put too many eggs in. At the time, I
        remember looking back to when I was sitting on the counter, cracking egg after egg into the mixing bowl. I felt bad. In December 2009,

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">
        <a id="2010.tag">My</a>
        school in Jinan only had two classes, Chinese and Math, or at least that’s all I took each day. In every city up to Qingdao, I would attend Chinese school in the morning and homeschool in the afternoon. Everyone getting out their sleeping
        mats to take their midday nap was my cue to look for my parents coming to pick me up near the doors. (At home, and often still to this day, we have "rest time", anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour of no talking and mandatory silent
        reading/napping/working time.) On the way back from school each day, we would pass by

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the butcher’s shop</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WWMlHD2.jpg"/>

        across the road, and my dad was the cool one who would stop and let us kids look at it for a bit. Now that I think of it, it was kind of gory, and the goats made really pathetic noises all the time, but I was fascinated. They would slit the
        goat’s throat and lay it out alongside the road so the blood would drain into the gutters. I would hear the bleating from inside my classroom every day. In school itself, I remember the math teacher being younger and prettier than the Chinese
        one. We used actual abacuses in math, which I found really cool. I remember I loved the math class and was usually bored in Chinese. I got in trouble a lot more in Chinese. For some reason, I was always proud and happy when I got sent over
        into the next classroom as a punishment. I would sit in the back of the adjoining classroom and wave at the other kids with a big smile on my face. I remember a few things about the food there. One, every once in a while they would have these
        buns with a sugary paste thing inside, and that was always my favorite. Another time, I gnawed on a bone until I got to the middle, in which I found things that looked like tiny bits of spinach or some other dark green vegetable. I also
        remember that they would have these quail eggs every so often, and I loved those because they were just like chicken eggs, but you could eat them all in one bite. One time, I think in Jinan, our landlord,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>whose daughter was friends with Selah</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rC4Bea0.jpg" width="500" height="360" />


        <span> <u>invited us into the mountains to pick these purple weed things</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DNMe27E.jpg"/>

        and have a meal with him and some other families. I specifically remember that this was the first time I realized that I didn’t like eating fish. Selah, on the other hand, ate the eyeballs. An odd thing I remember is that I was really good at
        sudokus during this time. I had this small yellow book full of them and I would always show guests how fast I could do them. I think I heard my parents remark on how fast I was a couple of times to guests and other friends. I also decided to try and memorize the entirety of

        <span>"<u>Brown bear, Brown bear, what do you see?</u>"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kL9ETli.jpg" width="571.429" height="800"/>

, which was apparently pretty impressive for my age, judging from everyone's incredulous reactions when I rattled it off for them. It wasn't very long, I just don't think many other 6-year-olds were trying to memorize their favorite book by heart just for fun. In our apartment complex, there were these glass pyramids and glass platforms that looked down into the basement below. Us kids were always really scared of walking/running over it for fear of it breaking. There were also these red stains/markings that our minds made out to be blood marks from someone who hadn't been careful enough and fallen through the glass. (Which then had to have been repaired, so I'm not sure how that was supposed to have worked out.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We had this moat that went around our central complex area</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/a0VwVLf.jpg" width="500" height="360" />

        It had several wooden bridges that went over, and it had tadpoles that swam in the water. It wasn’t very deep, but for some reason

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I loved to swim around in it</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N1qJwdU.jpg"/>

        I would especially like when all the grandmas would come out and scold me, saying I would get a cold. I’m not sure why I liked it, I just remember that it was funny when they all gathered around in a noisy bunch to tell me off. Me and Selah
        would often get small plastic bags to catch the tadpoles, but then we would always release them. I remember that one day in Jinan I took a nap as my mom worked at the sewing machine. This was the only nap I would take from the age of 2 to the
        age of 14. During the 5 years we spent in Jinan, we watched the first viral video of our family,

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>Charlie bit me</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV26" width="600" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1T3sJk47tKsfVidSP24S1Uzf9cZN9DuPY" preload="auto" controls></video>

        (This would be the first of many such videos, as you'll see later on)

        I think it was in Jinan and the start of Fuzhou that me and Charis began taking Taekwondo classes. As to the class itself, I just remember doing tons of exercises (like pushups) and the final belt test. Each student went into a room and stood
        in front of our instructors while we showcased our Taekwondo routine. After a few weeks, they were supposed to send us our yellow belts if we passed, but we moved cities before that happened, so we never got those yellow belts. Something I
        remember that relates to Taekwondo is when my parents gave me motivation to get stronger. I was really bad at pushups, but they told me I could have 100 (?) kuai if I could do 40 sit-ups in a row. I practiced and practiced, and when I finally
        accomplished the feat I felt so proud of myself.


        One Christmas (or some other special occasion), my parents (my dad specifically asked me, I think) asked me if I wanted one big gift or a bunch of small gifts. I thought about it for a while, and I eventually decided I wanted one big gift.
        They then gave me a baseball glove, which they had been saving for a time like this. I was super excited. I went out and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>played catch</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qYNs2vm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        with my dad a bunch of times after that. One thing my dad started in Jinan that he continued all up until we left China was our hangouts (we called them dates -

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>here's Kesed on one of them</u>)</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QheBCrl.jpg" width="600" height="448.6" />

        Since my mom got to see us a lot more (being a stay-at-home mom), my dad started taking each of us kids out once a week on a rotating basis. We would go to some restaurant (often McDonalds), have breakfast, chat, talk about life or any
        situations that were happening in our lives, and usually play some kind of game. At the beginning, these games were physical ones, such as Chinese chess,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Gobblet</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/p7kNCQf.jpg" width="500" height="500" />

        or 五子棋 (gomoku). In later years, like the end of Fuzhou and most of Qingdao, games were mainly played on his iPad, games like Ticket to Ride or Catan. It really did bring him and us kids closer, because it gave us long one-on-one time that we
        could look forward to.


        Either the transition to or from Jinan was really chaotic, and it was one where a bunch of kids were on an overnight train with one of the parents. (I think my dad.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Our family and DaYu were really close</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zoGNtTk.jpg" width="450" height=600"" />


        and she moved with us from Qinhuangdao to Jinan, and would soon move again with us from Jinan to Fuzhou.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I'm pretty sure Jinan was where my grandparents came on one of their trips to visit</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/tHQnrY7.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        One of the things we did with them was go to this park that had a pigeon-feeding area. I remember Charis was always afraid of them, and that I was at first, but soon

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was easily feeding them</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/87AJW8d.jpg"/>

        out of those small ziplock bags of corn the vendors there sold. Mimi (my mom's mom) brought along this big black bag full of pieces of a

        <span>"<u>marble tower</u>,"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dawWJtF.jpg" width="400" height="650" />

        something we would go on to play with a ton. Now, as far back as I can remember, my family had gone to conferences in Thailand for two things: there were homeschool conferences, where we would take standardized tests to make sure we were
        keeping up with academic standards, and AGMs, which were company meetings where the adults talked about boring adult stuff and the kids would do fun activities, with more and more bible stuff mixed in as we got older and older. At the first
        one I have a specific memory of, we were at the Lotus hotel. It was morning and my family was having breakfast. As we sat down to eat (and I had a big helping of pineapple, which I always ate at these conferences) I asked my dad if egg yolks
        were healthy or not. At the time, I heard him say that egg yolks were made of straw, as in hay. I was taken aback, and it wasn’t until many years later that I realized that he had most likely said that egg yolks had a lot of cholesterol, and
        that I had misheard him. Another thing that I did for a REALLY long time at these conferences was make "cheese juice." This was a 50/50 mixture of orange juice and milk. (It was called cheese juice because of its color) It wasn't too bad, but
        the reactions it got made it even better. During the one year we lived in Jinan,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got baptized</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5ZHWtTi.jpg"/>

        We all went to someone's house, and

along with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Emma Carollo</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PnvUyAA.jpg" />

        and Clara Wind.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>There was cake there as well</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3XP5ycq.jpg"/>

        and it was this big party. Which reminds me. One random day in Jinan, I was doing something in the dirt, playing with dirt or something. A couple walked by at one point and stopped to see what I was doing. This was very normal, and I didn't
        react. After a bit, they asked if I was afraid of the ants. Now, for some reason, in an inspired response I talked to them about how because of Jesus I didn't have to be afraid of the ants. Now that I think of it, I might have been playing
        with an anthill itself. Anyway, they listened for a bit, nodding and such. As I finished up, I saw an ant or two on my arm. I jerked my arm back and brushed them off. The Ayi then said "I thought you said Jesus let you not be afraid of ants."
        I realized my mistake and said "Oh yeah. I'm not actually scared. I was just testing you." or something like that. The only Father's Day we had in Jinan, my parents were trying to get a good picture of all us kids together. The problem was,
        there was always one of us that wasn't smiling, and the rest of us were forcing it. Eventually, my dad turned to my mom and said "get ready to take a bunch of pictures." My mom didn't know what he was gonna do, but just nodded. He then moved
        behind her and... mooned us.

         [Vietnam Veterans Museum], and the Lincoln memorial, which I remember as being a SUPER long walk. I had to push the stroller with the two youngest for most of the time. We also visited several of the Smithsonian museums. The only part of that I remember is

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>holding this big beetle thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PM5iifP.jpg"/>

        and getting two of these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dinosaur toys</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/h92NP6R.jpg"/>

        near the exit. It was one of those things where you squeeze the handle to make the top close, something I had always wanted. Eventually there would be some drama over them. I think one of us accidentally broke one of them and
        fought over whose the second one was.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We also saw the hope diamond</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ydjcau6.jpg"/>

        so that was pretty cool. After much asking, my parents bought me a "I ♡ DC" shirt, because I had always seen the New York equivalent in movies. We went to Mount Vernon, where I remember looking over the river to Maryland, waiting in a long line, then

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>getting my picture taken with some Chinese tourists</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/V1rlyNR.jpg"/>

        Bask at Mimi and Grampa's house, we swam a ton. This was the first stateside I had gone on where I knew how to swim all on my own, (since I had been learning the last time) so

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I was super excited</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/56B0an2.jpg"/>

        Something I definitely remember that might have been on this stateside (or the next one) was coming up for air one time only to get trapped under this

        I remember whipping my head left and right, panicking as I looked for the nearest edge. That was one of the first times I remember thinking that drowning would be one of the worst ways to die. We kids

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>always used to hang onto Uncle Mike in the pool</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r3xE5sW.jpg"/>

        in the rare occasion we were allowed to swim that late. As happened every time we went to the States, we had a big reunion with extended family. I remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sitting on the couch with a whole bunch of little kids while we took a picture</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j6u71sB.jpg"/>

        Dayu actually came with us to the states that time, which was super cool. She was the one that helped a bunch of us kids learn to swim. I'm pretty sure she herself learned to swim at one of the earlier statesides. There was this one
        restaurant we went to a lot, at least during the early stateside. It was Brooklyn Bagel. I always loved the strawberry and blueberry ones the best. To the side of the main ordering area was a kids place where I would always read this tattered
        book, maybe the Fire Cat? Something like that. Another one of the big places we visited was A&M. I think this was the first time most of us kids had been there.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Mimi and Dayu went with us</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jenaSJB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We did a general tour of the campus, and we also went to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the church where my mom and dad met</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QSE7uAS.jpg"/>

        This stateside was the first one that I clearly remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>being in the kids thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XT2Ka0z.jpg"/>

        in the church we went to, Crossroads. They had these sticker name tags that I found fascinating. Back at the house, this was the stateside

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I learned how to ride a bike</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DEaICNg.jpg"/>

        There is one place that I have random flashbacks to every now and then. It was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>science museum</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/U7zd6il.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        somewhere in America. I loved it. There was some kind of vacuum-powered ping pong ball delivery system that I did with Dayu a ton as well as a super cool water area. I guess I should talk about my grandparents' house, as it was where we
        stayed every single stateside. It has two floors, a decently large front yard and a huge backyard. In the back, they have

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a spa</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q3lNbKt.jpg"/>

        and a swimming pool. Actually heat up the spa, however, has always been a rarer thing because it takes time and energy to prep it. They have a cool pantry with this light that turns off when you close the door. I loved that as a kid. There's
        the wet room to the back right of the main door, which connects to the garden area outside and Grampa's workshop. We were never allowed to just wander around in there, because there were tons of dangerous tools. On this stateside, me and Charis (and maybe Selah)



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>made our boxes</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AZqekEb.jpg"/>

 with Grampa. And I mean <i>made them</i>, too. We helped him a bit to cut and sand the wood, as well as some of the painting. (All with his supervision, of course.) They were/are made out of wood, and we each chose the colors they were painted with. They had a small clock in the lid, and they included latches with combination locks on the front. The clocks fell out after a year or so, but the combination locks stuck around. I remember how we would find one after forgetting the combination, and I would use it to fiddle by trying every single code until my hands smelled super strongly of metal. At least once, I could have sworn I had tried every single combination without it opening. But yeah. I think I've always used it as a memory box, used in conjunction with my official memory box compiled by my parents. I've made sure to grab souvenirs from almost every major trip / vacation / stateside since, all so I can put it into my now-overflowing box.


 Here's a quick story. So, my grandparents' house borders one REALLY big house on the left side. Somehow, me and Selah became sort of friends with the two British kids on the other side of the fence. I remember for sure that one of them had a British-sounding name. (I think Tommy?) But yeah. We tried digging a hole underneath the fence so we could cross over into each others' yards. We came out over the course of several days/weeks to work on it, chatting all the while. We made a pretty big hole and got really dirty, and eventually we managed to dig out an area where we could leave notes between us and the two kids on the other side.



 In the garden I mentioned earlier, I
        always used to catch these green and brown anole lizards. That was the place where my lizard-catching habit got started. Early on, they used to bring one or two of the older kids along to drive

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the lawn mower</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1CtG2VU.jpg"/>

        I think it was only me, Selah, and Aiden that were able to drive it. Upstairs was where all the kids stayed. The place the boys stayed, the playroom (later called the Lounge), has a hidden entrance. The door is literally a fully functional
        bookshelf, so if it's closed it blends right in. There were a ton of toys in there for all but the last time I was there, including stuffed animals, this fuzzy town map carpet, Lincoln logs, and these giant colorful red top things, where you
        pressed on a thing at the top to get it spinning. There was also a small bookshelf there, by a reading area with beanbag chairs and an itchy green turf-like carpet thing. The books I loved to read the most were the Chick-fil-A superhero cow
        books as well as the "If you teach a ___ to ____" books, also from Chick-fil-A. Anyway, one of the coolest features of the upstairs was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the movie room</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9355bCU.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        It has

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>9 reclinable couch seats</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QIU5bOl.jpg"/>


        that face a huge screen on the wall. We would always get snacks from the little island area nearby and run inside to watch movies. There was also an electrical room next to the movie room that we were never allowed to go into. Right out the
        main back doors in the living room, you enter into a roofed area with a fireplace, a grill, a small refrigerator, and a bunch of small tables and couches.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>That's where we would roast marshmallows and make s'mores</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zZtrIcR.jpg"/>

        We kids always loved

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>burning the marshmallows</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/00hexJL.jpg" width="650" height="450" />


        because it was fun to see fire and because it always got a reaction out of the adults. There was a footpath that went all the way around the backyard. We always walked it with the dog, at that time

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a golden lab named Cooper</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7xpoVyc.jpg"/>

        Back to the memories. The next thing I remember is going to this park area with the Masseys, who had been visiting for a while now. There was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one area we wanted to go to that had a bunch of these periodic synchronized water spouts</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/c7uMyAp.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>It was super fun</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zsFwsQ1.jpg" width="725" height="525" />

        and I remember we stayed for a while. We spent a lot of the time trying to cover up the holes by

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>stepping on them</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j6Y6DC4.jpg" width="525" height="700" />


        <span> <u>holding them down with our hands</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qsl9anP.jpg" width="525" height="700" />

        or

        <span> <u>just sitting on them</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v4FWiMf.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        There were a lot of us there, so I guess we thought we could get them all. Right as we were finishing with that part, a scheduled "water show" came on. Music started playing, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we all started dancing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cWXZsem.jpg" width="700" height="525" />

        Some time after that,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Masseys had to leave</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wi9G29L.jpg" />

        <!-- acUAj100.jpg" width="700" height="525" /> -->

        One thing that happened this America trip was that I got diagnosed with ADHD. My dad had gotten diagnosed recently, and they wanted to see if I had it too. The doctor asked me a bunch of questions about how easily I dealt with noise, stress,
        and other people in general. I had to wait in the other room for part of the appointment. On the screen in the waiting room, there was a movie playing on one of the screens. (I later identified it as the Spiderwick Chronicles.) I remember
        watching a

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>scene</u></span>

        <iframe class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV2" width="800" height="450" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P04fPpYuQHJuWH9PWVxPnhem8Ogb2u51/preview" preload="auto"></iframe>

        where a man sacrifices himself for his daughter, invisible creatures dragging him of his yard by his feet and flower petals kidnapping him into the sky. Apparently this is one of the creepiest parts of the whole movie, because when I saw it
        later the rest of it wasn't nearly as scary. All I know is that I was traumatized by that scene. That night I had nightmares, and went downstairs crying to my grandparents watching TV in the living room. At one point, we did go to the
        McKowns' family ranch. A bit of background. The McKowns are the aunt/uncle/cousins that we interacted the most with, BY FAR. The oldest, Aiden, is three months older than me. Then it's Pierce, who's in between Charis and Kesed. Then there's
        Grae, who's about Makaria's age. They lived in China as well for many years, and only moved back to America sometime around 2015. Anyway, their family ranch was really cool, and it had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one bull</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KFU6Qn6.jpg"/>

        that was supposedly very dangerous. We weren't really allowed near it. The only other thing I remember about that ranch trip was that it was in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a dry, dusty desert area</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SJMgmgM.jpg"/>

        that it had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>one horse that I was afraid would bite me</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wXYuDws.jpg" width="375" height="550" />

        and

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>this educational TV show thing</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV4" width="640" height="360" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x1WYA1-NFVT_6lvTqg4HH13qSbbZtdy2" preload="auto" controls></video>

        that was on in the background one of the days. They were frog-like characters who were learning the alphabet. The main kid was in this lab where the scientist was explaining the letters and what noises they made. When the scientist asked what
        sound 'U' made, the kid said "uh...", and the scientist said "that's right!", and the kid smiled. For some reason that was really funny to me. Back in the Woodlands with my grandparents, I remember two things with the kid's program at
        Crossroads. The first was this debate with one of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the girls in the program</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwaTKDM.jpg"/>

        I said she was African-American, and she said no, she was just American. We went back and forth for a while on that one. The second thing I remember was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>giving this presentation about China with Selah and my Dad</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/f8dYCv2.jpg"/>

        and how we then had a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>race where we tried to pick things up with chopsticks</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8XYYIRz.jpg"/>

        Me and Selah were the best at it, of course, so we didn't fully participate, though I wanted to so I could smash the other kids. The next thing I remember was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>visiting Aunt Jenny in the hospital</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/wRY4AqB.jpg"/>


        She had just had her new baby. Aunt Jenny is my dad's half sister on his mom's side. Towards the end of this thing you'll hear about my dad's full family story. Needless to say, we did not spend much time with them. In September that year, we
        went out to some country house to get family pictures taken by Aunt Kim, because she was really good at photography (My mom's younger sister and the McKowns mom.) I remember it taking forever, and how there was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cool camera thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/JjQa5Dn.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        where you looked down through the top eyehole and it would show what was in front of it. One super random thing I remember that we did from back then was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>make these houses out of snack food</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YdjGEzc.jpg"/>

        I think it was for some sort of homeschool project, but I'm not sure. I just remembered another huge thing that happened that stateside. My grandma on my dad's side (we call her Meemaw) came and gave each of us kids

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these huge crates of toys</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6CWTcJC.jpg"/>

        The main toys I remember getting were these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>plastic dinosaurs</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W94An7S.jpg"/>

        These toys would be almost the only toys we would have to play with for a long while. My parents were mad at her for some reason, though. I later learned it was because my parents wanted her to spend some newfound money on something wiser,
        and specifically asked her not to give us big gifts. Late that October, we did our reformation day stuff on Martin Luther. As always, we did our pin the ___ on the ____ game. We never did celebrate Halloween, because my parents thought it wasn't a very helpful/meaningful holiday. Instead, we always celebrated Reformation Day with the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pin games</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Gxc0KrZ.jpg"/>

 and the

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>presentations</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kqueINf.jpg"/>

 as far back as I can remember.

 This year, it was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>pin the 95 Theses on to the door of the Wittenberg church</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Yesmhf3.jpg"/>

        That December, my parents went to Santa Fe to celebrate their anniversary. A few weeks later, my parents took us and our cousins to tour the Bluebell Ice Cream Factory. I don't remember much, just that

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we got some free ice cream at the end</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lckdEgn.jpg"/>

        Oh, and I also remember

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>milking a metal cow</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lb1MDga.jpg"/>

        That Christmas, all us kids had to dress up nicely for

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>family pictures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y626UD5.jpg"/>

        It's the first time I remember being dressed in fancy clothes. I remember two things about that Christmas. First, I remember being fascinated with how a nutcracker doll worked. Second, I remember being paired with Uncle Mike and my dad in an
        activity where we got random props and had to come up with a Christmas skit. We got a few hats and some baby powder. The only thing I remember from

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the skit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FFqGMpR.jpg" width="800" height="600"/>

        was me trying hard not to laugh and saying "baby Jesus has diaper rash!" So that was<a id="2011.tag"> Christmas.</a>

        Somewhere around that time I got bottles of this special bubble fluid that made its bubbles sticky. That was super cool to me. Since all of us kids were in some stage of learning to ride a bike, it was not uncommon of us to go round and round
        the circular driveway, each on our own vehicle. We would most often take baths in our grandparent's room, because that was the only bath bath in the house. At that age

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we would still take them together</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0ivQWbI.jpg" width="650" height="450"/>

        and we would always put in tons of bubble bath stuff. Late January 2011, the McKowns had to leave. I was super sad. I remember how we ate Freebirds (burritos) then

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>lined up in front of a random play place to take a picture</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/WAvdQYg.jpg" />

        Fast forward to February, when my grandparents took my parents and the three oldest kids to a horse-riding place. I was a bit nervous at first, but it became fun pretty quickly. I got

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>an old retired racing horse</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VZ7LgaP.jpg"/>

        I kept trying to make him gallop but he wouldn't listen.

        Charis's horse was a small one

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>that was led by a guide person via a rope</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5HDmnIP.jpg"/>

        I remember I wanted to take pictures of my horse doing its business on the road, but my mom said no. Somehow I still got one, and later made that her wallpaper as a prank. (Not included here.)

 Sometime that winter, a big macOS update had happened, giving Photo Booth the ability to take videos for the first time. Selah was the first to discover this,

taking videos of her playing the flute.

<!-- leftovers -->

We all thought it would automatically upload to YouTube or something, hence the website plugs and

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>us addressing our viewers</u>.</span>

 After the rest of us learned of this new feature, we all begged our parents to let us record videos of our very own. This was the very first time any of us younger kids had really done anything with videos of ourselves, since we never really had had access to any actual video cameras of my parents in the past, being too young. With that said, we each went into the guest bedroom on the first floor and recorded our videos one after the other while the rest of the kids waited anxiously outside the door for their turns. (Here's

 These were some of the only videos directly of us from this time, so over the years we've looked back at them a LOT, with each kid being embarassed at their video being shown each time.)

 It didn't stop there with Photo Booth, however. I wanted to record something really interesting, so I set up my mom's computer on a couch, called Kesed in, hit him hard, then ran and pressed record. And that's the backstory behind

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>THIS video</u>.</span>

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>me and Charis celebrated our birthdays together</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3rjowtH.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        Because it was our birthdays, me and Charis got to spin this wheel they had with different amount of arcade currencies as prizes. She got a small prize, but I'm pretty sure

 One last thing I remember from this stateside: one time, Cooper
<!-- leftovers -->

        On March 8th, 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we finally went back to China</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ajt6Wd1.jpg" width="900" height="600" />

        this time to a new city, Fuzhou.

      </p>
      <br><br>


      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">For the first few weeks, we lived in a temporary apartment while my parents went out in search of a permanent one. We basically lived off

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>packages of bread</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yG7Wo1F.jpg" width="668.75" height="500" />

        that we bought from a local convenience store. All I remember about that apartment was that the walls were very bright, it was very small, and there was nothing in it other than a small table. We soon moved into

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV72" width="640" height="480" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NWP-40Xou1CNgw04tbKHPvhZhFDlLFEG" preload="auto" controls></video>

        though, and got all our stuff in. (That video's from two or three years after where we're at right now.)

        I remember how the room originally promised to the boys was given to the girls, and I was mad at first, but my parents explained that the girls needed a bigger room because they had more people. Decoration-wise, I just remember eventually there being glow in the dark stars/planets on the ceiling above my bed, and a World War 1/2 informational poster on the wall with the door. (Feeding my acute interest in those wars later on.) We brought along our old wooden brown closet, which we had had all the way since Qinhuangdao.I’m pretty sure it was soon after we moved that
        we got these mosquito net tents for ourselves, because Fuzhou was the most humid and the most mosquito-heavy city we lived in.

        kindly provided by Charis. She starts in the living room, then looks into the boys' room. You can see the box I made with my Grampa on the desk to the left. Then she heads into the girls' room. As she's entering, you can see the soccer balls
        in the net thingies on the floor, which I'll talk about later. I'm on the two younger girls' bed playing Cooking Mama on my iPad. She quickly glances into the doorway of my parent's room, then walks back down the hallway, passing the
        homeschool room on the right.)

        I got glasses what must have only been weeks after we returned. One system that came into place soon after moving here is the week system. Us kids would fight over everything, like who would pray at certain meals, who would press the button
        on the elevator, and anything else you can think of. So my parents came up with a system. Since we had 7 people in the family, each person was assigned a day of the week. My mom was Monday, my dad was Tuesday, and so on. I was (and am)
        Thursday. Whoever's day it was got to do all the things we used to argue about. (Or had to do whatever work no one wanted to do). We still use this system for things such as chores. Soon after we came back,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I remember doing face paint with Dayu</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HiAHme8.jpg"/>

        I asked her to do Nemo for mine. Speaking of cosmetic-related things, I remember feeling left out whenever my mom and my sisters painted their nails. I would ask my mom if I could get my nails painted, to which she said yes, I could paint them with the clear-colored nail polish. That worked for me.) My dad got a Chinese tutor pretty soon after moving, and he would listen to the ChinesePod Podcast. But I should go ahead and describe our apartment complex. There were tons of plants. Palm tree-ish things,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>banyan trees</u>, </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/xbH2RpN.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        small ferns, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all types of flowers</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GP5s9PB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        (Including

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this one type</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YQHkHrt.jpg" width="600" height="565.95" />


        where you could suck sweet stuff from the stems) made our complex feel super natural. I think there was even a pomegranate tree that we picked from every once in a while (It was rarely ripe, though.) There were also a whole bunch of peach
        trees. We almost never got them ripe, though, because the BaoAns (guards) would take them all before we got the chance. The trees would have tons of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cicadas</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rIpdHA6.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        during the summers. They were super loud, but I didn't mind that, though it was startling at times. I would always try to

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>catch one</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/R7u7Pnm.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 but I became afraid to when I read that they could sometimes mistake your hand for a tree and stick their mouth straw-thing in it. (Someone had
        to show me how to catch them with my hands because of this, and I think the one in the picture is one they got for me.) The cicadas also left

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>their molted shells</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5dbdRns.jpg" width="375" height="500" />

        everywhere, which was kinda cool. Another thing about the trees - one time, I found this Swiss Army knife in a drawer that had a normal knife and a saw, among other things. The next logical course of action, of course, was to slash at the trunks of all the trees.
        They all leaked white sap, which I found super cool and interesting. Needless to say, I got into big trouble when my parents found out. Around the lowered sandbox area outside our house, there were these flowerbeds filled with small

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>purple</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/82N3Gtz.jpg"/>

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>yellow</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RAbuSYI.jpg"/>

        flowers. Bees and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these small purple/blue/gray butterflies</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/aDNP72Y.jpg"/>

        would be on these flowers almost year-round. I tried to catch the butterflies all the time. They were easy to catch. When you did, they would sometimes leave gray/purple dust from their wings, which I thought was cool until I found out doing
        that to a butterfly can kill it. Another time, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to catch a bee using a leaf. I picked a decently thick one off a nearby bush and lay in wait. Before too long, I had caught one. I victoriously strolled up
        the ramp to our building to show my mom, when all of a sudden it stung me THROUGH the leaf. I dropped it instantly and watched as it flew away. I just remember that the sting was SUPER itchy. I went upstairs and my mom put baking soda on it.
        (After she and my siblings made fun of me for trying to catch a bee and expecting not to get stung.) Immanuel was at our house when that happened. He was there playing with Kesed upstairs when I had baking soda covering my hand.

        Our building was at the end of a long strip of buildings. We had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this giant square</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PVhNZHJ.jpg" width="700" height="700" />

        next to our house that was kind of

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>the central playing area</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV71" width="640" height="480" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MOy-fGYq1JjLc00Hq-WzlVqPd1X_PpBp" preload="auto" controls></video>

(video credits to yours truly, with the old camera I got on my birthday.) When it rained a bunch,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we kids would often go outside and slide around in our bathing suits</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GyaeJ1l.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        It actually got a few inches deep before it was able to reach the drains down the main pathway.

 One recurring game we played in this area was a market/economy game using the fake American money we had for homeschool, both bills and coins. Everyone (including Anais and Lisa as well as sometimes Lani and Kina) would get a bunch of books and toys from inside the house and set them out on blankets all around the square area. We would then label them with prices according to their percieved worth, and we would then engage in buying/selling/haggling for our wares. We did this a whole bunch of times. One time, we did do it inside, though it was a bit more cramped. Kesed had a lottery business, where you paid $1 for a chance to draw from a few slips of paper, one of which was a prize of $5. The problem was, he only had a couple slips of paper in there, so he was losing money. I felt soooo bad watching him trying to act enthusiastic as person after person won, his money slipping away. Me and Selah went over and tried to help him, explaining how to adjust the pricing/lottery system in order to make more of a profit. That situation REALLY had an impact on me though, because I just felt absolutely horrible at seeing him lose all his money while trying to stay enthusiastic on the outside. That's probably why I remember it so vividly, because I just felt that bad. So that was the fake money game we had.

At the far corner of that square was this old gate/tower thing. We were all small enough to slip through the bars whenever we wanted to go up and
        down. We most often went down in order to go to Yonghui, the supermarket that was visible from our apartment. There was always this weird cat hanging around the bottom. It was stray, and it had one blue eye and one brown eye. It was kind of
        cool but also kind of freaked me out. A couple of meters out

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>our door</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VNh9hjI.jpg"/>

        was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this lowered area</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/lWt7xcQ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        It had two

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sandboxes</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cDLhdiD.jpg" width="804" height="600.52" />

        (in which we built a ton of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sandcastles</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cZ4jPs5.jpg"/>

        ) old people exercise equipment, and the usual trees/flowers. A small walk away from our apartment building was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the edge of a river</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/6T7mBXV.jpg"/>

        We never swam in it, but we did walk/bike by it a couple times. At least for the first year or two, the youngest four

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>all went to the same Chinese youeryuan</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/IqNdMlO.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        in the morning. We were still homeschooling in the afternoon though. I have a couple of funny memories from the one year I was at this youeryuan. One time, a teacher cut a chunk of a girl's hair off because she had misbehaved. I took it in
        stride, but when I mentioned it to my parents they were shocked that the teacher would do that. Apparently that's not allowed in America. Another thing that happened was that my teachers kept forcing me to use my right hand. At that time,
        especially with the older teachers, left handedness was seen as some kind of disorder that needed to be fixed. When my parents found out what they were trying to do, they sternly let my teachers know to let me use whatever hand I wanted. When
        I lost a tooth, everyone said just throw it out the window, which shocked me because my parents gave us money each time we lost a tooth. (They did away with the whole tooth fairy thing.) My classmates were all obsessed with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>aotoman (Ultraman) and the monsters they fought</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/VQl8n9v.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        The classroom had a bunch of these Ultraman action figures that we would all play with. I remember hearing how there had only ever been one American Ultraman, and how he had died fighting one of the monsters. I milked this as much as it was
        worth, saying that the American one was the best because he had given his life to beat the monster. I remember trying to find as many reasons to milk my American status as I could. For some reason, the kids at that age all HATED Japan. They
        would always mention how badly Japan had treated the Chinese back in World War II. This was the ONLY time I heard of Chinese people hating Japan so much. After I left Fuzhou I never really heard much about it. Maybe because I was around older
        people. Anyways, I took advantage of this to point out how Japan would never have been stopped if it hadn't been for America coming in and defeating them. And that's how I learned the Chinese word for "atomic bomb" at the tender age of 7.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">One time, my teachers all got everyone in my class

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these metal puzzle things</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ij3by69.jpg" width="425" height="300" />

        No one could solve them. I got them apart using brute force, but they said that didn't count. Eventually the teachers looked it up the answer for themselves, and they were finally able to solve it. They didn't tell us the solution though. I
        think I ended up being the first person in our class to solve it, something I was super proud of. Every Monday, we would all line up outside and salute the Chinese flag as a few "special" students marched up to the flagpole carrying said flag
        and raised it to the top. every once in a while, we would get ready for these events. Typically, these were some kind of performance, gatherings, or just some program the school wanted us to go through. One I remember well is one where me and
        my classmates had to jump rope. I wanted to be the best at jumping rope. I skipped around and around the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>courtyard area</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ioHuS2T.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        Every time we were taken out to practice. I would try and see how many jumps I could do in a row without messing up. As I was more walk/skipping than jumping quickly in place, it wasn't long until I got into the thousands. I was super proud
        of myself. I remember how I wrote them all down and compared the numbers from each day with math of some sort. I was super proud of myself. One thing that I associate with this time period is coloring with some other kids and asking for the skin colored one, namely peach. My parents told us not to call it that and to call it peach, since not everyone's skin was that color. My thoughts were that every other skin color had a normal name, like brown, yellow, red, or some mix of the few. Caucasian skin color has only that one crayon to match the color. There <i>were</i> a few really spoiled kids at that youeryuan. My mom had to intervene several times
        with this kid who would always hit his grandpa who came to pick him up. Also at youeryuan was this computer room where we would be allowed to go every once in a while. I always played this fish game where you start out a small fish and can
        grow bigger by eating anything smaller than you. You get bigger and bigger until you're the biggest fish. I was hooked. Eventually, on my last day there, my youeryuan teachers let me go to that room and play for about an hour before my mom
        came to get me.

        Once, my mom bought a bunch of seeds we could grow on our back porch. We were each assigned a certain type of seed. I claimed the strawberry ones first, though everyone else was kind of wanting them as well. (The other seeds were like
        tomatoes and other boring things.) Anyway, we each planted our seeds

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>in our own container</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kqWq449.jpg" width="550" height="450" />

        I must have either heard it too late or I wasn't listening at all, but I planted too many strawberry seeds and too close together. Turns out that if you do that the roots strangle each other and nothing grows. So that sucked. I realized right
        after I had planted them that I had messed up. Now here's a really random thing that I somehow remember clearly. Apparently our Uncle Casey (that's the uncle on the McKown's side) made some joke in a video about how you could hold the area
        around your belly button in a way that looks like a "hairy bagel." I kind of understood it, but not fully, and I remember thinking for way too long about why the adults found it so funny.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We kids still copied it though</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/X9ittdh.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        Alongside Dayu, we got a few more good family friends early on in Fuzhou.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Enya</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N6dcWnL.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        the Lees, the Funderburks,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Yamma</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/UMbhvlc.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and to a lesser extent the Chus. I'm not sure where we met Enya, but we were friends with her all the way through our Qingdao years. She had a similar role to Dayu, just to a slightly lesser extent. The Lees were also good friends of ours.
        Mr. Gerald, the dad, was super fun. I remember he had this mark on his face from when an iron fell on him as a kid. That made me super scared of irons. Mrs. Evelyn was also fun, and she brought their kids to a bunch of our hangouts. The two
        kids,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Lani and Kina</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/o3OD7v8.jpg"/>

        (Lani on the upper left, Kina on the middle left) were super close friends of ours. Lani mostly hung out with Selah, because they were around the same age. Kina was Charis's best friend, also because they were around the same age and loved
        doing similar things. The Lees lived in an apartment strip across the canyon area, so it wasn't too hard to get to their house. The Funderburks were made up of Mrs. Regina, Mr. Kevin, Drew, Chayli, and eventually Esther and Eden.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Drew</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vcQSSjJ.jpg"/>

        was about 7-8 years older than me, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chayli</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r1Ra6cc.jpg"/>

        was around Selah's age.

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Esther</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KTSTaVE.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 and

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Eden</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BIbn3VL.jpg" width="534" height="801"/>

 were adopted a year or two into our time in Fuzhou. (I remember the Funderburks bringing them out from inside the van from the airport one late night.) Me and Drew would go on these hangout times, when
        we would go to mall areas, chat, maybe get some drinks, and just chill. We would talk about all sorts of things. He liked this one book series, I think <i>The Ranger's Apprentice.</i> He also liked My Little Pony, for some reason. The only
        things I remember from our hangout times was once when we discussed the difference between Pepsi and Coke and this one time where he bought me / I bought this mini pool table toy from one of the shops in the mall. Chayli was a good friend of
        ours who we hung out with a decent amount. One story, though, that stands out to me that involves her is this one time at dinner when we had her over. We were talking about school stuff, and at one point she mentioned what math level she was
        doing. (Keep in mind she's about Selah's age.) Now I was homeschooled at this point, so I had no reference up to that point where I was compared to everyone else. I knew that we might be a bit ahead, since we could go at our own pace and we
        didn't take summers off (though the frequent conferences and vacations might have made up for that.) But when she said what level she was at, I instantly felt a burst of pride. It was the first time I realized that I was ahead of everyone
        else. After hearing her response, I remember saying "Oh... I feel something a little proud coming up..." after she said that. My parents quickly rebuked me, and that was probably when it sank in to never talk about myself and my academic achievement, especially in comparison to others. (It would just made me embarrassed for them.) I don't remember a ton about the Chus. We were around them a lot less than those
        other families. I just know that we would always play Wii boxing at their house, and that I was pretty good at it.

        All of them went to our house church, at least for the first two years or so. Throughout our time in Fuzhou, also keep in mind that there were teams of volunteers coming through nonstop. We probably met 20-25 people that way. Oh, another
        thing that started in Fuzhou was my mom doing Makaria's hair. In order to have it at any decent length, my mom had to go through it with oils, lotions, and several types of combs every morning. It was and still is quite the noisy ordeal, as
        it's apparently rather painful. I should explain our visa runs for a bit. I think this is the first city we did them. From 2011 on, my family was on tourist visas. This meant that we had to leave the country every 90/60 days. (It changed a
        year or two after we moved to Qingdao.) In Fuzhou, that meant this: we would wake up at 4 AM (I remember going outside into the calm, cold night air into the pseudo-empty streets, and being reminded of the empty blinking stop sign in Cars)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>took a train</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SipdxSl.jpg" width="600.52" height="804" />

        (often a rather

 experience) to a tiny island that was part of Taiwan so technically "out of country," walking out the doors, turning around, walking straight back in, said hi to the security beagle (which I always teased Charis as
        being afraid of, since she was super afraid of dogs at this point) and returning to Fuzhou. Every 90 days. But back to the regularly scheduled programming.

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">Around this time, my mom and dad surprised us kids with a trip to Hong Kong Disney! The day before we actually went to Disney, we did a little tour of Hong Kong itself. All I remember is that late afternoon we
        went to some wax museum. That night,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we went up to this high place so we could see the skyline</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FOXEfW4.jpg"/>

        The next day, we went to Disney.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We took the fancy Disney train there</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XrAtqHF.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        <span> <u>We took pictures with all the standard people first</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/SCEBG8e.jpg"/>

        Makaria was scared of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Jack Sparrow guy</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/M26jgZZ.jpg" width="675" height="450" />

        None of us knew who he was, because we hadn't seen the Pirates of the Caribbean yet. (And we wouldn't until many years later.) I remember



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>going through the Tarzan exhibit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OPsxD44.jpg" width="450" height="650" />


        not knowing what it was, because I hadn't seen that yet either. Which reminds me, a few weeks or so before we went to Disney, some friends of ours had came and hidden these small objects (such as that battery) around the various rides and
        exhibits. We were given clues and had to find them. Anyway, next we did

        <span> <u>the teacups</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BEOoyF1.jpg"/>

        and

        <span> <u>the it's a small world ride</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/QD8hJlt.jpg"/>

        At one point we found Buzz.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Kesed went up to him</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pKRHaFR.jpg" width="450" height="650" />

        and said "I love you, Buzz!" and hugged his leg. Later, there was this 4D show we watched. It was something about Donald Duck and magic. At the very end, he flew towards the camera and we heard a huge crash in the back. When we looked back,
        his back half was flailing in the top of the back wall. Towards the end of the day, we got

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cotton candy with these cool light-up sticks</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ezrchtL.jpg"/>

        Back in Fuzhou, one of the first things that happened was one of Kesed and Makaria's school events. We all went to the carnival/festival-like thing. They had a bunch of activities there, including this shallow pool area that they had filled
        with fish. We were supposed to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>grab a plastic bag and catch them</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/AXf6B81.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        which was harder than it looked. In our homeschooling, me Selah and Charis had started this astronomy course. We learned all about the planets, stars, etc, and my mom

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>made up projects for us to do</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/72YTU9L.jpg"/>

        to help us learn. Late June 2011, I had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>my graduation performance for youeryuan</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CuMMokP.jpg"/>

        I remember anxiously waiting in line behind the stage, watching as the other classes went forward for

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>their performances</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B82jfpG.jpg"/>

        (We were the highest class, so we went last.) Now, there are two big things that were only a big thing in Fuzhou: my dad's long work trips and care packages. My dad often went on long trips to teach, preach, or complete part of his PhD
        program (these were the longest, because he had to go to America.) On the especially long trips, my dad would leave us with a little booklet/list. There was one for each day he was gone, and they would sometimes have chores (everyone make
        sure you get your rooms clean, organize your closets) and would sometimes have a treat (watch a movie in the theaters, get ice cream, etc.) Every entry also had a little note from him saying how much he loved us and some words of
        encouragement. It made us feel like he was still at home, and it definitely let us know he cared about us. The second thing I attach to Fuzhou is care packages. Every so often, our grandparents, church, or volunteer groups would bring

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>these huge boxes of stuff from America</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gK81p0u.jpg"/>

        This is where we got 99% of our fun stuff. (One thing I remember especially well was this small

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Optimus Prime</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8mh3Ibs.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        <span> <u>transforming lego set</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DpknokK.jpg"/>

        It was the first lego set I ever had. Before, I only had access to those giant Duplo blocks.) We kids would always wait impatiently for our parents to cut them open and see what was inside. Typically, there was stuff dedicated to each of us,
        along with some group stuff for the boys or girls. My parents were included, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>they would get things specifically for them as well</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ocP7V5z.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        There would be toys, books, games, candy, movies, cereal, or any number of other things. Many of these were especially significant because we couldn't get a lot of the candy/cereals in China. I remember how corn flakes used to be a special
        treat, and how I once ate half a bag of Twizzlers (soon after they came) while I was doing the kitchen. Speaking of the kitchen, that was where my mom taught a bunch of us how to cook. She taught us a whole bunch of dishes, partly, she explained, because she didn't want us to be one of those people in college who eat packaged food and PB&J sandwiches for every meal. The thing I most clearly remember her teaching us was French Toast. You would whip some eggs together, put some cinnamon in, maybe some milk, then dip pieces of bread inside. You would then flip it over to ensure both sides get doused, then put it in the pan, where you would cook/flip the pieces of bread until it was solid and a light shade of yellow and brown. One time, I was cooking something, I don't remember what, when I suddenly felt my pinkie start to get hot. I looked down and the oven mitt I had on WAS ON FIRE. I half panicked, then ran over to the sink to put it out. That was a bit scary but mostly really cool. So those are two of my cool kitchen stories. In Fuzhou, there were a few orphanages that we visited often. The long walk to the main one wound through a college campus, I think THE
        Fuzhou university campus. That one had regular kids. Then there was this other orphanage we went to (less often) that had kids with disabilities. I became especially good friends with one kid from each. The one from the main orphanage's name
        was

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Stephen</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CkeBk78.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        We hung out for about two and a half years. He would always come over to my house to hang out for the day. He was a bit rowdy, and my parents sometimes had to warn us not to hurt each other (especially in certain areas) when we would wrestle. We also did this velcro organ-body mat thing a couple times. I hung out with Stephen a bit
        more than the other kid. I don't remember his name, though I think it started with an A. He was from the disabled orphanage.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We would ride these little wheeled things around</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/v3Ta6hF.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>blow bubbles</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/rAPxcDc.jpg"/>

        which he loved popping. This orphanage was more rural and far away than the other one. I think we had to get a taxi whenever we went. We went to the regular orphanage pretty often, especially when volunteers or other guests flew in. We did
        things like fold clothes, babysit the kids, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>cook food</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9xLFda.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        September 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we celebrated our first Passover</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/chWwHrO.jpg"/>

        We kind of did this as a fun tradition, and we still do it to this day. Back then, we would all dress up, my mom would make the traditional Passover food, and we would go through all the typical Passover stuff with the difference that it had
        more of a Christian theme.

      <br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">A bit more about our larger surroundings, though. There were a few sections to our apartment complex, A-D. We were in D. Each section was a strip of apartment buildings, and we were at the very end of our strip,
        near the big empty square and the abandoned ivy-covered stairway. At the other end of our strip was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>open area</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Oi2K9DB.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        with a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>dried-up fountain</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vYAF6ph.jpg"/>

        some white tarp things, and paths leading into the road on the left. Those paths along the road is where we went to more of the farther-out places. There was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>canyon-structure</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XKYXnCj.jpg" width="802" height="599.025" />

        that ran alongside section D, with stores all along the bottom. These stores became somewhat of an interest point, as shops would open and close within months of each other. New expensive shops would open selling wine or something and within
        5 weeks would be shut down again. It became kind of an inside joke, wondering "how long is this one gonna last?" At the end of our strip past and below the empty square we always played in, the canyon joined a perpendicular canyon. Where they
        met there was the big supermarket named YongHui, where we got most of our stuff. (This was a place that I remember being COVERED in Santa paraphernalia around Christmastime.) As you entered in the front doors, you could either continue out the other side or turn to the left, where you would have the main supermarket area on your new
        left. By the doors on the other side of the main entrance, there was this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bubble tea place</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/h1RiYFQ.jpg" width="600.52" height="804" />

        This was the first time I had ever heard of bubble tea. I didn't really like it, so I (and a few others) would just get lemonade drinks. We went there decently often, I think. We would send a few kids (I always remember me and Charis doing
        it.) to go and get drinks for everyone. It had a TV up on the wall that would play Mr. Bean episodes. That would sometimes cause us to stay a bit longer than we had to, because we would just stand there watching the screen. Back in the main
        store area, I remember it being semi-dimly lit. It had row after row of shopping items, with the cold areas in the back. The leftward section that you would turn into after entering YongHui had the registers taking up most of the left side,
        and closed down / small expensive stores along the right side. At the end, though, past the registers on the left, were these small shops selling cheap kids toys, goldfish in tiny containers, and other small trinkets like that. Past that,
        near the third exit, was the glasses shop. I don't think this is where we actually got any of our glasses though. Out that exit was a dark covered alleyway area that led into another building. A bit to the left and in through a pair of doors
        was a hallway that had the Dongbeicai place we always went to in and on the left. (To the right was some other random restaurant, maybe a random fast food place? There were never many people in there.) We went to the Dongbeicai place (as it
        was named) a ton. We always took volunteers and other fly-in guests there to try out some real Chinese food. It was really good. I remember how here and in previous restaurants we had to ask them to give us normal plates and silverware
        instead of the plastic-wrapped ones, because that would save 1 kuai per set. When eating here, I realized at one point that I loved the little

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>peppercorns</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MYzKYTv.jpg" width="600" height="500" />

        that were found in the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>干煸豆角</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/qmlOt2i.jpg" width="600" height="400" />

        I would always pick them out and eat them by the handful, much to the amusement/disgust of my family members. I don't know why, I just loved the numbing feeling. Right outside the Dongbeicai place, there was a super bright spotlight thing
        that always had dead moths on top and live moths flying around it. I'm really not sure why I remember that, but I do.

        In that general direction was our

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Chinese school</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/r0eKMRv.jpg"/>

        (not the youeryuan) which we accessed through small sidewalks and pathways. Right before crossing the street to get to the school, there was a small area that held this convenience store. It was where all the students got school supplies. I loved pencil cases, especially the ones with all the little compartments and cool features such as a compass, tool kit, etc. It
        was also where I would eventually collect these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Lego Ninjago minifigures</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/DReCyGV.jpg"/>

        In Fuzhou, there was this park a long walk away that we went to often. It had a big lake area with

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>weeping willows on the banks and vendors all along the paths bordering it</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kjivjCZ.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        You could take boats onto the lake, though we only did this a few times. This is one of the places we would always take the volunteer teams that would come. Late October 2011, we were eating meatball subs one night when we started hearing
        this loud meowing outside our door. It didn't stop, and eventually we opened the door to see what it was. On the ground, a few feet from our door, was this tiny kitten. It was in terrible shape. Its fur was dirty and you could see its ribs.
        We didn't know it at the time, but it also had fleas. We brought out a small bowl with bits of meatball in it to see if it would eat, but after continuing to hear meows from outside our door we decided to bring him for the night. We cleaned
        him up and made him comfortable. In the coming days, we would get rid of the ticks and buy some watered down cat food to keep him going. We sent out ads for a cat that was available to adopt (my parents had no desire for a permanent pet at
        this point) but in the meantime

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we took care of him</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zezLijj.jpg"/>

        We decided to name him Tex, short for Texas and the phrase "don't mess with Texas", which the Funderburk and Vaughn parents found really funny for some reason. A month or two after we found him, the Funderburk family adopted him from us. A
        few days after we found Tex, Kesed and Makaria got in trouble. My mom got a call from Mrs. Lee, who lived in the apartment strip across from us: "I see a little white hand and a little black hand throwing stuff out your window. Thought you
        might want to know." My mom went to the room in question and saw Kesed and Makaria chucking

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>anything they could find</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0aJaQQ.jpg"/>

        down into the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>porch/garden</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/XvAWq8y.jpg"/>

        below. My mom had to ask the downstairs neighbors to let her in so she could pick up the books and underwear in their bushes. Needless to say, Makaria and Kesed got into big trouble.

        We celebrated Reformation Day a bit late that year, on November 2nd. Normally, we celebrated it in the place of Halloween. To this day I still don't think I've gone trick-or-treating. This occasion, me and Selah prepared for an interview
        hosted by our mom. This time, we did research on the work of John Calvin.



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We wore this knitted beard in turn and answered questions</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9pYSQt.jpg"/>

        (Enya, Dayu, the Lees, the Funderburks, and the two volunteers at the time were all there.)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We then played "Pin the Petal on the Flower</u>,"</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/5KBq7xS.jpg"/>

        as per our tradition. I think it was petals and flowers because of John Calvin's quote about flowers (“Would the Lord have dressed the flowers with a beauty that runs freely to meet our eyes if it were wrong to be moved by such beauty?")

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Enya and Dayu participated in the game too</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/P99iilR.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        I don't remember who won, but whoever did got a big bag of candy. Dayu won one year, and Makaria won another one.


        That November, my grandparents took my family and the McKowns on a two-week vacation in Thailand. These next accounts are only semi-chronological. This trip was the first time I realized I didn't like

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Pad Thai</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pMhNPwR.jpg"/>



        <span> <u>We went swimming</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/snGoqg5.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        a whole bunch there, as you might expect. At one point, as I was walking barefoot across the wooden planks, my big toe caught in something and I got this huge blood blister. (No picture included) So that was painful. I have memories of three
        different games from this trip. My Grampa played Plants vs. Zombies a lot, and we all loved watching him. When I could, I would hide behind the couch and play it on Aiden's phone. Aiden himself would play this game where you could send out
        various tiers of stick figures to fight monsters once you earned enough money. It was the kind of game where people attack at a set speeds, and your goal is to get them to advance upon and destroy the enemy fortress. It was all about points
        conservation, in other words. You had to spend them wisely on the right troops. Anyway, I remember watching him play it a lot and strongly hinting that I wanted to play too. The one time I did get it he had to take it right back because his
        mom called him. The third game I remember from that trip was a word-finding game that Mimi (my mom's mom) would play on her iPad.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>She would let us play the game both on our own and with her a decent amount</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PX8WphF.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        One day on the trip, we went to an

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>elephant park</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/YKbFnPu.jpg"/>

        We did all the normal things, like go to the soccer/art/

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV3" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo3()" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OVXa96RYhxw8uEoftxzlIM4PZdd2mpnQ" preload="auto" controls></video>

        show, take one on a ride, and go to the place where you could feed and pet one

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>up close</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9kPZC0r.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        There was one baby elephant that was especially cute. It had a bit of hair on its head, so it looked more like a kid as well. A few days later, my dad, Uncle Casey, and Grampa took the oldest 3 kids to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>go fishing</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/2NfznOR.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        It was at a specific fishing place that made you let them go after you caught them. I remember how there were two lakes, one with piranhas and one with normal fish. Apparently there had been a leak recently and some piranhas had gotten into
        the regular area. I only caught one or two normal fish, but Aiden actually managed to catch a piranha. I remember Grampa joking with the fishing employee guy when they threw in the bait, saying "Chum! Chum!" when the bread crumb lumps would
        fall off the hook. I didn't get what they were talking about at the time. While we did that, I think the younger kids watched the Pippi Longstocking movie back at the house. From then on, all they (and eventually, I) did was sing the theme
        song. ("Pippi Longstocking, coming into your town. A friend of Tillytown, oh no no no.") We all got the little jingle in our heads. I critiqued, however, that it didn't make sense, because she was the hero of the story set in Tillytown, so it
        wouldn't make sense to say that she wasn't its friend. A day or two after we went fishing, we went to this night safari place. We saw a bunch of animals, but the only one I specifically remember was the zebra, because

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>it came right up to me</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/cdw0WW9.jpg"/>

        I remember that in

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the waiting area for the safari place</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B0oiV78.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        there was one of those things that projected something onto the floor that you could interact with, usually by stomping on whatever you were supposed to stomp on. (It had little games on it.) Now, throughout the whole trip, I had been playing
        on the basketball hoop in the front area. This was the first time I had done anything relating to basketball, but I thought it was super fun. It had a chain net that made a super satisfying noise when you made a shot. I remember trying to
        make a total of 1000 shots over the course of the vacation, which I managed to do by shooting a lot. On that trip, the boys got these Thai boxing shorts (seen

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>here</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/GRGx8qx.jpg"/>

        flexing next to the basketball hoop) and the girls got Thai dresses. Towards the end of this vacation, Selah and Grampa put on a puppet show for us. It was about a married

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Mrs. Kangaroo and Mr. Penguin</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/pGqmOPO.jpg"/>

        At one point, Grampa (as the penguin) mentioned how he wanted fish. I then pointed out (from the audience) how penguins didn't eat fish, but krill. (I was in the middle of a penguin phase that lasted several years, so I knew quite a lot about
        them.) We took a bunch of

        towards the end of the trip. The McKowns would leave first. I remember being really sad as they loaded into the van. We left soon afterwards, but we didn't go right back to China. Instead, we went to visit the Shores. We had this bread dish
        called "Monkey Brain," which put me off before I realized it was pretty good. I think I spent a good amount of time looking for this Magic School Bus book about shrinking and going into the human body in their house. I'm not sure why I
        thought it was there though. I also made a big tower out of letter blocks. After a day at their house, we finally went back to China. A few days after that, I lost my first tooth. It was when we were doing church at the Funderburk's house. I
        went into the bathroom because my tooth had finally given way a whole bunch. After the getting-a-very-loose-tooth out routine, I remember being super happy that I had finally lost my first tooth. I had a plan to make a model of my childhood
        teeth by collecting them as the fell out and putting them into a clay model. Unfortunately, that plan didn't work out right away, because (I think) it fell into the toilet and was flushed away.

        In early December 2011,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Altics</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/1hCv9US.jpg" width="625" height="450" />

        came to visit. They did a whole bunch of stuff with us, but for some reason I wasn't there a lot of the time. I do have an isolated memory of being the person wrapped in toilet paper for a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>snowman contest</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CoQCyGU.jpg"/>

        held among this bible study group thing with college students, Mr. Gerald Lee, and the Altics. I thought my group easily did the best, but I don't remember if we won. At one point they went and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>helped move things out of one of the orphanages</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/a2wFY5Y.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        I think I didn't go on that one either because I had gotten in trouble or I had complained about the long walk. One night, my parents took them and us to this tea shop, where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>us kids watched a movie</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/C9i451x.jpg" width="800" height="554" />

        with Curious George and and an elephant while the adults talked to the store owner for a long time. Another thing we did was take them to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this long street</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/22AeqMH.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        my parents took all the visitors. I never liked going there, because it was a long walk away from our house. On December 18th, kids from the Vaughns, Lees, Funderburks and Chus performed a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Christmas skit</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/PmvqTHm.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        for all the adults. As we moved into late December, Makaria had

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this performance for her youeryuan</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4ldiYqd.jpg"/>

        where she had to wear

        (It was the brand.) I remember how all the adults found it really funny, and some of the kids understood it some, but it's really funny looking back at it now.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Christmas morning</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/y27iJxB.jpg" />

        we had cinnamon rolls for breakfast, as we often did. This Christmas was the first time I remember doing our long-standing Christmas tradition. As many

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>past Christmases</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV41" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo41()" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1efG_8hcEn0iAOakFyxUw_0gDzkJRBMdO" preload="auto" controls></video>

 as I could remember, my parents have never given us big gifts. They gave what fit into our stockings and maybe one or two
        small items, but that was it. They saw it as wasteful. (Needless to say, they never for a second had Santa Claus be a thing.) Instead of getting gifts, they had us kids (or at least all those old enough) to research a certain charity and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>give a presentation</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/B0c7tZb.jpg"/>

        to the family about what it did, and my parents would donate the money that would have been spent on gifts on these charities instead. Now, as long as I can remember, my family has had a tradition called Family Night. Every Friday night, we
        would do some activity together. In recent years, the activity has mainly been movies, but in years past they could be game night, crafts night, or any other family bonding activity. (Us kids always preferred the movie nights, though.) Once
        or twice we even went to the movie theater to watch a movie there for Family Night. In Fuzhou, what we would often do is run to this convenience store on the way to LiHong's (our tutor, who you'll hear about later) house, get some drinks, and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>we would eat dinner</u> while we watched the movie.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/W5SZG81.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

	Usually my parents picked awesome ones, but there was this one time... So they were looking for a movie one time, and they found this one 'flick' (as they called movies sometimes - when they did, I always thought of the movie A Bug's Life, for some reason) that looked fun enough. Well, turns out it was about this parallel universe where the other mom tries to sew buttons into the main character's eyes. Yep, they had picked Coraline. Apparently, it had looked like just a normal kids movie on the page they got it, and the ratings hadn't given any indication otherwise. Nonetheless, this was the first movie we considered stopping halfway through. I especially was SUPER scared. I really didn't like it. It completely creeped me out. I might not have been as scared if it wasn't dark, at night. In the end, though, we did finish it.

        <a id="2012.tag"><u></u></a>

        January 2012 finally rolled around.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I turned 8</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/MSmQgc8.jpg" width="800" height="560" />

        In that picture, I'm holding one of the posters my family made. We have a ton of birthday traditions. The night before, we set out handmade posters from each one of us along the pathway leading out their door. The birthday person has no
        chores, and they can pick any dinner and any movie they want. At dinner, after we've all finished eating, we go around and say what we love about them. We go youngest to oldest, though skipping over my dad. He gets to say as many as he wants
        once everyone else is finished. That was always his thing. When it's his birthday, us kids would sometimes clamor to be that person, but it would always fall to my mom. Oftentimes, especially in later years, the kids would combine their funds
        to buy a gift, and my parents would get the big gift you would look forward to all year.

        One thing we did for fun a lot around this time was make these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>domino lines with little plastic squares</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/j82MgvT.jpg" width="400" height="600" />


        from some homeschool set.

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);">(<u>Here</u></span>

 you can see Selah and Lisa doing that while the younger kids watch Anais do Stickman Epic.)

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV45" width="608" height="1080" onload="offvideo45()" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1onAlVZgCmB6R4qw1Cq3ZCgR7U_QSVbFn" preload="auto" controls></video>

 Which for some reason reminds me of this. During our first year in Fuzhou, we somehow met these two French/Chinese/Japanese/Cantonese girls, Lisa and Anaïs Herberger. Lisa is between my and Selah's age, and Anais is
        a bit older than Charis. I don't remember how we did meet them, but we did, and they were us five's best friends for the entire 4 years we were there. We went to their house (which was super nice and had two floors due to them being at the
        top of their building) for their birthday parties,

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>they came over for ours (middle)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uRQ86CU.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

        every single day when we finished our work we went outside to play with them. At the time we met them, they knew/were learning 7 languages. When we met them, I think their younger brother, Antoni, had just been born. Lisa is the girl I next
        remember liking. When I went on statesides or vacations and saw Anna again, I would start liking her again, but Lisa was the main one for Fuzhou. every once in a while I would look at Lani Lee or Chayli Funderburk with a bit of interest, but
        not for very long. They lived

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>right behind us</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9UMh0S3.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

 in the apartment complex directly across this metal gate we easily slipped through all the time. That reminds me. There was this one guy that would always wander around our neighborhood. He had a
        potbelly and might have been drunk 24/7, not in a scary violent way, more in a dazed, lazy, staring way. We named him Albert. Anyway, one day Albert watched us squeeze through the gate to get to Anais and Lisa's apartment area. A few minutes
        later he waddled over and tried to get through himself. We all stopped and watched as he became hopelessly stuck. After a few more grunts, he gave up, pushed himself out, and walked away, scratching his butt. We just burst out laughing.

        Late January 2012, we went to Thailand for another trip, either a vacation or a conference. This time in Thailand, I remember walking through street markets to get to this food court, where me, Charis, and my dad tried to find taxis from all
        colors of the rainbow through the window. We met with



        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Masseys and the Shores</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/q2cKql8.jpg" width="875" height="600" />

        and hung out with them for the whole trip. I actually remember walking out to the area where we took that picture. I was thinking about paper-mâché at the time, maybe something to do with how we would paper-mâché a balloon to get

        the piñatas

        we would always have at birthday parties. Anna gave me

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this hand-made wooden plane</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sVVz6xw.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        she made as a birthday present. My parents gave me

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the 2012 Guinness World Records book</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/N6pxsuj.jpg"/>

        I read that book so often over the next few years until the cover then the pages came off the spine. One of the things we did with the Masseys was go bowling. I just remember that they put up the bumpers for me and Anna, because we weren't
        very good. Soon after, we met up with the Peeks to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>ride elephants</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/CQNBDcL.jpg"/>

        A few days later, we went back to Fuzhou.

        By February 2012, my mom had worked on

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>her book</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/KgCZuJm.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        for several months. She was really proud of the title. I think Aunt Kim designed the cover. I remember how my mom stopped her from putting a little smiley face in the top left corner as a little Easter egg thing. Anyways, in early March, two
        volunteers came that would be one of the few volunteer groups I remember clearly. Their names were

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Tim and Patrick</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fGBHAa4.jpg"/>

        (Tim is on the upper left, Patrick is front and center.) We hung out with them a TON. I think they were there for 6 months all together, which is probably why I remember them so clearly. I remember how Tim could beatbox really well, and us
        kids loved it. We would go on the "beatbox train," where we would hang onto his back as he walked around the living room beatboxing. We thought it was just the best thing ever. Patrick was super fun too, though. Both of them were around for a
        super long time, and I think came on several different occasions. It was somewhere around this time that I met

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Immanuel</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3y8YAUt.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        He was a Korean kid who lived nearby. In fact, he was the only foreign boy near my age in the entire neighborhood. The Herbergers, Lees, Chus, and Funderburks (with the exception of Drew, who was 7-8 years older than me) all had families of
        2-3 girls only in each. I remember when I first met him. He and his dad came up to the Vaughn/Lisa-Anais group when we were playing in the empty square area. He said how he had heard there was a new foreign kid in the neighborhood, and he
        introduced the two of us. One of the first things we did was walk down our apartment strip and on into the next, talking about whatever. At the end of the second strip, we went in this little bamboo forest area. I think we got sticks there as
        well. Anyway, around there I asked him if he was a Christian, because I didn't want him being a non-Christian to get in the way. He said yes, as could be seen in his name, and I realized where I recognized the name "Immanuel" from. We became
        super good friends. I went over to his house for a bunch of sleepovers, and we would always play Minecraft, the demo version though. I loved it. One time, Kesed came with me, and after nagging and nagging us to let him play, we finally let
        him get it a few minutes before we had to leave. We gave him a gold sword, telling him it was the best one in the game (it's not) and we turned it to Hard difficulty when he went into the other room. Needless to say, he died in like 5
        seconds. At Immanuel's house I think I would have those tiny raisin boxes with the girl on the front. They were pretty good. On one sleepover, I was super hyper. I kept talking and he wanted me to go to sleep. In what I now realize was an
        excellent strategy, he told me that he had this thing where he had tons of negative emotions inside and normally let out 1% during the day, and how he needed to release more of it at night, so I should be quiet to let him do it. I questioned
        that idea at first, but he told me Obama said it was true, so I went quiet. I remember standing with Immanuel on a bridge over the canyon structure and listening to

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>Gangnam Style</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV24" width="800" height="450" onload="offvideo24()" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gyW0Igo7pgBKOWtR4wR7DguiMJuHrb4y" preload="auto" controls></video>

        for the first time. One time, we followed a trail of bird feathers into a hole into the ground. We felt so excited and apprehensive about "tracking down a snake." I also have memories of him calling his dad in Korean and asking if we could
        come over for the afternoon. That was when he was on top of this

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>giant ladybug thing</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/2aD5f1x.jpg" width="400" height="650" />

        in the playground on the opposite apartment strip. There were I think two of those, and one of them had a hole in it, so we could go inside, since it was hollow. This was the playground where I would curl up in the plastic tube parts reading the one or two Spiderman comic books I had found somewhere. (maybe a garage/yard sale or something?) There's another story with this playground, which I'll get to in a minute.
        Immanuel is also where I was exposed to

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Ninjago</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/fD52gik.jpg" width="650" height="400" />

        Geronimo Stilton, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (of which I liked the brown one, because it had a lot of boy/girl stuff,)

        and this other book series about a newt. (I once got in trouble because I read one of the newt books on the way back from his house, and I apparently lost track of time and was an hour late. My dad had to come out and find me, and I wasn't
        allowed to read the book before the day I had to return it.) We watched

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>Ninjago</u></span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV69" width="1280" height="720" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1zADiFq9LeEnZL1WWOyp_W0Nup8jUctLf" preload="auto" controls></video>

 all the time with him. (Only Season 2 though.) Me and Kesed LOVED it, and one time we asked my parents to let us watch some for family night. Finally, they said
        yes, and one day (I think right after running, another thing I'll talk about) my dad took me over to Immanuel's house and we got the disks. I had been super impatient about getting them the past two weeks and my dad told me that they had
        everything planned out. The first and only night we watched it, we only did one or two, because each episode was 45 minutes, instead of 15 minutes like I thought/told my parents. Another thing I did with Immanuel a couple times was wrestle. I
        had the quickness, and he had the strength and weight. Come to think of it, I wrestled with a lot of people, Kesed especially. We were more physically matched in Fuzhou than we would be in Qingdao, so we went at it all the time. Each
        apartment strip had this rain drain

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>sewer-like system</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zfzXTh6.jpg" width="534" height="801" />

        It was pretty easy to get into, and it was super fun being able to get from place to place underground. It was only about 6-7 ft deep, and concrete grates covered the top. We used it to travel/sneak around as well as find bamboo sticks
        (ranging in length from dagger to spear) to fight with. Speaking of bamboo sticks, there was this one time with Anais that I was SUPER proud of at the time. We were arguing over who this one stick belonged to. We were at a deadlock until I
        thought of an idea. I asked her in a challenging tone, "did you put it in that exact place?" (pointing to some random place to the side.) She said "Yes! I put it right there, for sure. See, I know where it was. It's mine, give it." I then
        shot back in triumph, "Well, I didn't really find it there. I found it a lot farther away, so this must be mine, and you just made it up that you put this one here!" She didn't have anything to say in response, realizing she had made a
        mistake. I felt soooo proud of myself at the time. In fact, I went up and called my mom from the window, telling her of my clever plan to get the stick.

        In early April 2012, my family went up a mountain with Tim and Patrick around the time of the sweeping of the tombs holiday. I remember stopping for a break while we

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>took a picture</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OOpccS9.jpg" width="533" height="800" />

        and taking a (maybe glass-bottomed)

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>gondola</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0bWvdlN.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        on the way down. About a week afterwards, the boys and girls

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>went into mosquito tents on each of our porches</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/3z5IYMY.jpg" width="650" height="450" />

        to go "camping." We brought out flashlights and everything. We didn't even sleep there, though. Something happened, maybe it was too hot or something, but eventually we all went back inside. I should mention a bit about our homeschooling
        stuff. To teach us typing, my mom used <a href="https://www.dancemattypingguide.com">Dancemat Typing</a>. We used that website for a LONG time. For science, me/Charis/Selah were all on one curriculum, and Kesed/Makaria did some small
        activities on the side. The oldest three had a textbook, online stuff, and a kit full of things like test tubes, magnifying glasses, and crafts. I used magnifying glasses to burn ants (no, I'm not a psychopath, and yes, they smelled like
        grilled meat) and try to make fires with dead grass and leaves. We did experiments included in the course and made up by my mom. We did

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>baking soda volcanos</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/FVZj38d.jpg" width="600" height="800" />

        and we once salted a slug when we did our biology course. It wasn't pretty. In a few minutes, it had bubbled, swelled up, and died. We had a whole bunch of strategies to make homeschool interesting. One we did for a while was stations,
        where we rotate between math, history, science, reading, handwriting, games, etc. every 30-45 minutes, counted using this animal noise timer app.

        But back to the main timeline. On April 22nd, Tim from 'Tim and Patrick' got baptized. I think he had gotten baptized when he was a baby, and he wanted to do it again, so

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>my dad baptized him</u>.</span>

        In Fuzhou, we were introduced to four thus-far new modes of transportation:

        (Side note, because this doesn't really fit anywhere else - Lisa and Anais had wheelies, normals shoes that had wheel come out the bottom if you positioned them a certain way. We were all super jealous of them, but we never ended up getting any because they were so expensive.) At night, this area was filled with palm-sized toads jumping between the lampposts. I would always catch it and pet it on the way home. But yeah. April to June 2012 was the time when I wrote most of

 I guess I had just gotten my drums and all, but I was super in the creative spirit. I spent TONS of time on these, and I loved how easy it was to mix different instruments I didn't even know how to play.

 I especially liked using all the synth instruments, as you can probably tell.

 Early May 2012, Charis was riding one of those things in the empty square near our house when she fell
        over and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>broke her arm</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yoin9yv.jpg"/>

        I just remember coming home from somewhere else and seeing my dad holding her arm wrapped in a blanket. She and my mom went to Hong Kong for about a week to get it taken care of. Since she broke her right arm, she had to learn how to use her
        left arm. This led to her being a bit more ambidextrous than the rest of us for a while. (Me and Kesed are left handed, possibly from Mimi, who's left handed as well.) I think it was only a few days after that where Kesed hurt his toe. He was
        carrying this big rock from one place to another (who knows why) all by himself (despite us offering help) when he suddenly dropped it onto his toe. I remember him crying and it bleeding a ton, grossing me out.

        We got roller blades from somewhere, I'm not sure where. I think it was just me and Selah who got them. I had some orange ones, and she had some blue ones. I couldn't do it for very long each time, though, because it would rub against the
        sides of my ankles and chafe the skin.

        Now's a time as good as any to talk about my reading while in Fuzhou. Fuzhou is really the place where

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>I got into reading</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/gkBv1uH.jpg" width="525" height="600" />

        I had known how to read since the age of 2, of course, but I hadn't really read for fun. This changed in Fuzhou, especially when we started getting books on

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the Kindle app</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/aRXokFD.jpg"/>

 on our iPad. I think the first series I read in full was Narnia, but after that the order kind of mixes up. Here's a roughly chronological
        order of book series (with lengths): Lord of the Rings (3), Fablehaven (5), Hunger Games (3), Percy Jackson (5), Eragon (3), Geronimo Stilton - Kingdom of Fantasy (6), Divergent (2 of 3), Land of Stories (6), the Star Wars Sextology (6), Wally McDoogle (many), Magic Treehouse (many), the Clone Wars - novel version (1),

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Gulliver's Travels (kids version)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/4Rc2p5f.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        Junie B. Jones (many), Ramona Quimby / Beezus books (many), and most likely
        a couple more that I just can't remember. My mom tried getting me into the Hardy Boys, but they were boring. (I did read one or two Nancy Drew books, though, sitting outside in the area between us and Lisa + Anais's apartment complex. Selah teased me a bit for reading/slightly liking it despite having called it a girly book before.) As far as detective/mystery books went, though, Encyclopedia Brown took the cake. It took me a while to get into Hunger Games, because I quit at first after reading the first few pages, saying that "this is just
        about some cat." Eventually, though, my parents persuaded me to read the rest, and I loved it. Our family has a policy that if one of us wants to see the movie adaption of some book, we have to fully read the book first. Most of our books
        were on the Kindle app on our iPads, with the exceptions being Fablehaven, Narnia, and Lord of the Rings. I think I was the first one to finish Lord of the Rings. Before I began, I had heard my dad talk in some restaurant about how he was
        reading it, but I had assumed it was some theology thing, since it had the word 'Lord' in it. I remember watching each movie after I had finished the accompanying book with my dad in the living room at night. On the last one, Selah made us
        popcorn that was way too salty. (Random - we always made popcorn at home in a wok filled with vegetable oil. It was cheaper and actually a lot healthier, since we never put butter on. My parents never let us have things like mayonnaise
        and butter because they didn't want us developing a taste for it.) Anyways, I remember crying at the last scene. My dad put his arm around me and quoted one of the lines from the movie: "Not all tears are evil.". I was really slow on the
        Divergent series, and I never got to the last one. It just kind of got boring. Fablehaven was super fun though. I remember first seeing them in our bags coming back from some conference. They were in one of those plastic holders book series
        come in. I remember how I read the 1st book in 1 day, and the 2nd book in 2 days. I wanted to keep that pattern, but I couldn't because I got in trouble on the 3rd day of the 3rd book and had to go to bed early. So I finished that one in 4
        days. I then continued on to finish the 4th one in 4 days and the 5th one in 5 days. I was super sad when it ended. I kind of just laid in my bed with watery eyes as I put my book to the side. Around the time I started getting into reading,
        my dad started reading with us kids at night. I think the first book he read was the Hobbit. That was really fun. Then we read 100 Cupboards, which was a bit creepy but still kinda fun. Then we got to Harry Potter. We would end up reading the
        entire series of Harry Potter this way, with him reading to us sprawled out on the couch, over the course of both Fuzhou and Qingdao. Before we started, I was slightly against it, because I thought it was some horror book. I think the last
        one had come out pretty recently (Editor's note - the last movie came out July 15, 2011), so I was seeing these scary posters about them everywhere. Randomly, around this age I constantly had Chinese people come up to me and say I looked like
        Harry. It must have been the glasses. I did have decently round glasses at that point.

        Not too far from our house was a

public swimming pool.

 We went there pretty often. It had a

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>kids pool</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/grCPlkX.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 and an

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u> adult pool</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/ajF3z6k.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 I remember going through the changing room with all the naked Chinese guys changing on both sides. We
        had to step through this foot-cleaning pool before we stepped into the main area. I thought that part was gross. Eventually I started avoiding the kids pool when I realized how often they were peeing in it. This is also where I realized I
        needed goggles that covered the nose, unlike the other kids. I still don't know how people swim with the smaller ones. They're super uncomfortable for me. We would always get our goggles and other swim stuff at the pool store they had next
        to/in front of the adult pool.

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We played tons of games</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uxDubSU.jpg" width="802" height="599.025"/>

 when we went (often with groups of other kids/families), like Colored Eggs, Marco Polo, and a few other games I can't remember. Colored Eggs is this one game Anais and Lisa taught us.
        It's where everyone chooses a color, and the person that's It calls out colors one at a time with their eyes closed and tries to catch people as they try to reach the other side. The first person to get caught is the next one It. One time, we
        were playing this out of the pool, in the empty square, and Selah didn't specify which category of color we were allowed to choose from. (I chose 'clear'.) They couldn't guess mine after an hour, and they continued to guess over the next few
        days. I teased them with stuff like "it's all around you" and "it's the most common color in the world." Eventually, when I told them, they got all mad and told me that I had cheated. But back to the pool. One time, when we were going on a
        pool trip, we had just left that in-between-apartment-strips area down a long, wide ramp leading to the road with the pool when we saw this huge dog/wolf thing. (We would always call it 'the wolf'.) It had tangly, matted gray fur, a foaming
        mouth, and dirty, broken strands of a rope attached to its neck. Maybe I was just small, but it looked huge. (Judging from my mom's reaction, it actually WAS huge.) My mom (it was just her that day) dragged all the kids to the side, behind
        one of the bushes that lined the ramp. She held us behind her and the stroller as she watched the wolf's every move. She told us to be quiet. There was also these two other women on the ramp. One was old (maybe in her 70s), and I think the
        other one was in her 50s. The older lady had bags of groceries in her hands, but she dropped them when the wolf started up the ramp. She ran a safe distance away and started screaming at it. The wolf moseyed around and slowly approached the
        groceries. It began poking around, then eating all of the groceries she had just bought, while the lady herself screamed her lungs out at it. I'm not sure what happened after that. Most likely, my mom edged along the wall and we all went off
        the other side of the ramp towards the pool. Later, when we returned to the area where the wolf had been, we saw a few drops of what looked like dried blood where there hadn't been any before. We established the theory that the old ladies had
        called the police, who had come and shot it.

        Late May, we began having huge fruit fly problems. They were everywhere, and they were super annoying. We tried all sorts of tricks. We did the

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>paper funnel trap</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/BVQ9Pa9.jpg"/>

        with meat / honey / fruit at the bottom (it worked because the flies were too dumb to fly back through the hole but were willing to fly in through the top), slapping them by hand, and anything else we could find online. We caught a ton, but
        there was always more. After a few weeks of this, I was digging around in the girls room when I found this old plastic bag. It was disgusting. I think it had rotting fruit (maybe banana?) in there, but there were bunches of fly eggs, tons of
        white fly larvae crawling around and of course adult flies everywhere. Needless to say, after we got rid of that bag, the flies mostly went away. Another pest problem we had in Fuzhou was with cockroaches. I think they were the fat Texas
        cockroaches (no picture included), but most of the ones we saw were the nymphs. They were most common in the kids' bathroom. I'm pretty sure this was real, and not a nightmare, but I remember going to the bathroom one night, turning on the
        lights, and seeing the floor COVERED with cockroaches, who then all scattered to the walls. I jumped onto the walls and held myself above the ground until they were all gone. I remember that LiHong recommended this one strategy that actually
        worked pretty well. It was this kind of cockroach poison that attracted other roaches to eat the bodies of the dead ones, killing them and continuing the cycle. It was effective because the initial roach would often die inside the nest,
        allowing the poison to reach past the little paste tablets we would set down on the bathroom floor.

        so you can have a checkpoint for what I looked like at this point in my life. That summer, we watched the Olympics nonstop. The biggest events for us were swimming, gymnastics, and occasionally running. (My mom also has a close personal friend who's an Olympic gold medalist in diving [Laura Wilkinson], so we watched a bit of diving as well.) Almost every day, my parents would put on the Olympics for us all to watch. One day, we kids made the discovery that

        </span>

 for the Olympics ['Bugler's Dream'] was on our 'Classical Music' app, and some of us decided to have some fun with it. We hooked an iPad up to the speakers, and played the theme song out loud in the living room. Kesed came running out instantly, with Booboo (his bear stuffed animal) and blanket in tow. We all laughed at his expense, and he went back to his room, disappointed. Despite this, we REPEATED the trick one or two more times, and somehow he kept being fooled every single time. That was super funny. (Side note, while on the subject of pranks - one time, Selah (helped by the others + Lisa/Anais) pranked me by putting plastic wrap over the toilet seat. Needless to say, I was not very happy. I made Selah clean it all up.)

        The next big event was the arrival of

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Paige (top center) and Lydia (upper right)</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/HKW3PXY.jpg"/>

        the next significant set of volunteers. I remember Paige a lot more than Lydia. Not only did she visit us later right after we moved to Qingdao, but she was the one who taught us this "doi doi doi" thing. When you put your hands a certain way
        over your mouth and say "girl" in a super deep voice, it sounds like you're saying "doi" in a super high pitched voice. I remember that VERY clearly because of

        <span class="selector" onmouseover="reveal(this);"><u>how entertaining it was for us</u>.</span>

        <video class="hidden" style="text-align:center;" id="myDIV8" width="800" height="600" onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseleave="revealon(this);" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14zmL2OKGZ86-d350kLxptOfBNj6omnfU" preload="auto" controls></video>

        At the time I also liked Paige because I thought she was really pretty, but hey, that was just me. They were there for two weeks, I think, but they stick out I think because of that doi doi doi thing. They hung out with Selah and my mom the
        most. Paige did some spa thing with my mom, thats all I remember specifically.

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We took them</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/mLbBdvp.jpg"/>

        to all the usual places, and we did a ton of stuff with them at the regular orphanage /

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>with girls from that orphanage</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/c2kOiyh.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        (I think that one was when Selah invited them to have a sleepover at the orphanage, and she acted as their translator as a 10 year old.) Selah was at that orphanage a lot. She helped out / joined tons of teams and summer camps to help the
        kids there. That was kind of how she first got the "responsible one" reputation, because she was doing so much at such a young age.

        Now I feel like I should cover my Xiaoxue experiences all in one go. I started going to my Chinese elementary school on

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>August 30th 2012</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/zU5mi1G.jpg" width="400" height="600" />

        I was there all up until 3rd grade, after which we moved to Qingdao. I only remember four of my classmates' faces. Two of them were the class "leaders." I'm not sure why I thought of them that way, maybe they were the official class leaders
        or something. It was one guy and one girl, and they were both pretty nice to me. I remember at one point I went to the front of the class to arm wrestle the leader boy. (I'm not sure why we were doing this in class.) We were deadlocked for a
        whole minute, with the other kids cheering both of us on, and eventually I let him win so we both could end it. (No, that's not my excuse, that really was my motivation.) They could get bossy at times, which is maybe why I think of them as
        being in charge. The third girl was a bit chubby, and had darker skin and curlier hair than the rest of the kids. My mom theorized that she was mixed. She was super nice. And
        lastly, I remember the face of this one kid that was super mean to me. He and his friends would always gang up on me, cursing me out and saying other mean things. I actually didn't know the meaning of the word he used towards me most often,
        (what I learned many years later was the Chinese equivalent of the F-word), just that he said it when he was mad. Not knowing what it meant, I used it whenever I was mad, especially towards him. That would always make him angry, which was
        satisfying. He also repeated this rhyme he had a ton. “范勇强，不吃中国的白米饭，只吃美国的黑炸弹." ("Malachi doesn't eat China's white rice, only America's black bombs.") I didn't really get what it meant, so I would simply corrected him by saying that I ate
        rice for lunch every day when I went home. The one time I remember him repeating that the most was as we were lining up after exiting the bus for a field trip. Now, these field trips were a big deal for us kids. We would get our raincoats
        ready just in case and pack a lunch the day before. We were always so excited. There are two places I remember going to often, and one place I remember going to once. One was this huge forest area where we would walk through the trees and
        enjoy nature. The second one we went to often was this small amusement park area where you paid for each ride you went on. As a result, the class was limited to a certain number of rides, and we all had to decide on which ones we wanted to go
        on. On one occasion, we all voted to go through the haunted house as the last ride of the day, which I had been eyeing for a while. As we went through single file, the other kids got freaked out, and everyone started to push forward in an
        attempt to run faster. I was super enthusiastic, though, and I wanted to stop so I 1, could get the full experience of the house, and 2, show off to my classmates how brave I was. But the people behind me kept pushing, and so I was forced out
        with everyone else. I just remember seeing the crying face of the bully guy in front of me and feeling really smug. When we were all outside lining up, everyone was quiet, but I was super energetic. The third place, the one I only remember
        going to once, was this ship-building museum that was in the middle of a shipyard. There were huge metal frames and towering cranes all over the place, and scrap metal littered the ground to the sides of the path. It was a pretty boring
        museum, and I complained about it when we got back. For all of these field trips, we had to bring our own lunches. Lunchtime on these events was a big thing. It was where everyone compared meals and traded choice food items. I especially
        loved it because my mom would always buy more snack food for these trips than we normally got at home, like full

        on my 8th grade fall trip. The fruit itself isn't very good though. It's way too sour.) I was always proud of how generous I was with my food. I always shared with all of my classmates. So those were the field trips. I remember a couple other
        things that happened at that school as well. I once beat 5 Chinese kids in a fight in the courtyard.

        <span>(<u>This picture</u> includes the white things/middle apartment complex area on the top left (our apartment strip is the tall buildings with red roofs also on the top left), and my elementary school on the bottom left, including the

        </span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/sTIVqrD.jpg" width="950" height="588" />

        It was during recess, when everyone was running around doing whatever. I don't remember what I normally did during this time. I think I either wandered around or looked at dirt/the only tree in the courtyard to see if I could find anything
        interesting. Things like that. Anyways, I just remember becoming really excited when I saw the fight was coming, and excitedly bragging about how I had won when I got home. In what I think was my first year at this school, they did this
        soccer program with the entire student body. We all had to bring our own soccer balls in these

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>gold and black</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/F6zaEJh.jpg"/>

 one.) Me and Charis always kicked them as we walked on the way to school. Every day at the same time, everyone in the school would be led out to the soccer field in the back. We would always do some stretches (including the rolling wrist/ankle
        ones) first, and if it was a Monday we would salute to the Chinese national anthem. They would make us hold the salute position for a long time while either student leaders or teachers came by to inspect us. We had to hold our hand in an
        exact way, and our feet had to be very close together. (For many years afterwards, when I was standing at rest anywhere else, I would notice that my feet were super close together. I think this is why.) I remember arguing with my classmate
        about the national anthem. At one part, they talk about overcoming the enemy's cannon fire, but the word they use for enemy, 敌人 (di ren) sounded a lot like 'demon' to me. (Chinese has a lot of words that sound exactly like their English
        translations, like ka fei (coffee) and qiao ke li (chocolate).) I argued that no, no matter how bad the Japanese (I assumed that's who it was referring to) were, they weren't DEMONS. My classmate argued back that yes, they were <i>di ren</i>.
        After we had stretched and done all the intro stuff, we would start our soccer stuff. We would do and then a soccer dance that involved various moves and drills, all to the song "Waka waka" by Shakira (the 2010 World Cup song). Every time I
        hear that song now it makes me thing of those times on the field dribbling around a soccer ball. We would then walk off through the right side of the school building with "Baby" by Justin Bieber playing through the speakers. (My mom and dad always made jokes about Justin Beiber, who was blowing up at the time. They pretended to be offended at the "...don't need no Starbucks..." line because they've always been a <i>huge</i> fan of Starbucks AND coffee in general.) <i>Baby</i> doesn't
        have quite the memory connection the Shakira one does, though. There was this wall on the side of the ramp leading from the back of the school. A lot of times kids would climb all along the edge. One time, I climbed higher than I had ever
        seen anyone else climb before. I'm not sure why I did it. Maybe it was to impress the other kids/peer pressure. By the time I got to around the top, I was ready to get down. I must have been around three meters up, though. I paused for a long
        time, the kids on the ground egging me on. Finally, I jumped, landing on my feet but hurting my knees/ankles and getting myself scraped up on the ground. At one point in the latter years of school, they held this competition among all
        students in the school. At the event itself, we would have to pack a bunch of school supplies into our bags, then tie our shoes. (And maybe a few other of those type-things as well.) We practiced for the competition weeks in advance. I kept
        not being able to practice during class, because I would forget to bring my string-tied shoes and instead wore my velcro ones. I undid the velcro straps in order to simulate shoestrings a tiny bit better, but the teacher still kept having to
        remind me what shoes to bring next time. When it got to the actual competition, I tried my best (using shoestring shoes for the first time), but a ton of other kids finished before me. (We were lined up in row upon row of desks on the field,
        with the school supplies spread out on the desk and shoes untied.)

        I never did my Chinese homework in school. At least, I didn't do it consistently. When I could, I would do it, but I wasn't very good at doing my Chinese classwork. I did do the rest of it though. (Apparently, my parents let my
        teachers know beforehand that they weren't too concerned with me homework stuff, since I had homeschooling work to do at home as well. I didn't know that at the time, though. I found this out many years later.) Another iffy thing I often did
        in Chinese class was cheat off of classmates during tests. My teacher once gave a talk about cheating, but she said that it was fine, because we were taking the risk that our classmate had the wrong answer. I went home and told my parents
        about it, and they told me that I still shouldn't cheat because it's not right, and said "you're not cheating, right?", to which I nodded and said "Of course. Yeah, no." So not my best moment. Besides Chinese, I think the other classes I had
        were math, music, and social studies. I only remember one thing from music class. At one of our practice sessions for some concert, we stood on some bleachers in the music room for what felt like several hours. I was in the back row, so
        eventually I was able to squat down behind the others for short bursts of time. Near that room, on the second floor of the building, we watched "the Ant Bully" in a darkened room. One of the things I did to entertain myself in some of my
        regular classes was write all the Chinese characters I knew that didn't have a "一" in its character. I remember my classmates surrounding me as I explained what I was doing in the notebook. There are only a few more things I remember from
        this school. One day, I had a period where I realized something and thought for a super long time about why we are here. Obviously I knew all the Bible stuff, but it was a moment of thought to look back and see how generation after generation is born, lives similar lives, and dies, over and over and over again. That afternoon, when I got back home, my parents helped talk me through those kinds of questions. At one point, I began drawing Bible scenes on the bottom left corner of the blackboard during breaks. I think I hoped that someone would ask me what I was doing, and I would have an opportunity to talk to them about the Bible.
        I'm not sure, but I think it worked a bit. I remember getting into a conversation with the boy beside me about whether he wanted a Bible. I think it was during class and he was more trying to listen to the teacher, but I kept nagging him
        until I think he said yes just to make me be quiet. I went hope super happy, explaining to my parents how I had shared the gospel with someone and now they wanted a Bible. I told them I wanted to give him the blue book of kids' Bible stories.
        They were a bit more hesitant about the situation, and they told me to keep talking to the kid before we gave away one of our Bibles to them. I was disappointed at the time, but now I see that I was moving a bit quick, not to mention that
        handing out Bible stuff would have been a bit of a security liability. Now, the Fuzhou dialect is very different from Mandarin, and we heard it being spoken every so often. When our teachers tried teaching us the dialect in class, though, my
        parents told all of us not to listen and to do whatever we wanted at our desks. They didn't want our pronunciation messed up by mixing the two, which was a good call, because the sharp pronunciation skills practiced through going Chinese
        school would give me a huge advantage later on. A few more small stories I remember from Chinese school. One time, they were giving a lesson on how we could make little sayings to remember the composition of a character. (It'll make sense in a second.) They asked if any of us had any of these of our own, and if we would present the saying to try and get the class to guess the character. I had been thinking for a while, and finally I raised my hand, and I proudly marched up to the front of the room and said "白色的王坐在石头上“, what I meant as 'the white king sat on the rock." This was supposed to reference the character ”碧“， which has 白 [white], 王 [king]，and 石 [rock]. I guess the way I said it wasn't correct or wasn't clear, because I remember everyone staring back at me, having no clue as to what character I was talking about. That was a bit embarrassing/frustrating, since I had been so proud of coming up with such a good memory 'jingle'. Another thing I remember: When we learned the character '黄', my teacher told us that we should never forget how to write it, since her name was 黄老师.

                                            <p style="text-indent: 3.0em;">But back to the main timeline. One thing I remember doing in the States is going to the apple stores and playing on the iPads/iPhones that were on display. My favorite game to play on those was

                                              <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Jetpack Joyride</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/uWtxDmW.jpg"/>

                                               for sure. I think I knew of it because I had played it once or twice on Grampa/the McKown's iPads at some point, but whatever the case that's the game I went to straightaway most of the time. Now, I should mention despite this being our summer "break", we didn't actually do those in homeschool. Since we were away at conferences and travelling decently often, and we would take days off every so often, my mom had us

                                               <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>do work</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vXCAJbI.jpg"/>

                                                all through the summer and holidays. That's one thing that helped me/us get ahead in school. Anyways, one thing during this America trip that I really started getting into was Legos. I had both a small plane and a small car at first. (I'm not sure where I got them from.) I loved taking them apart and putting them back together again. At one point, I

                                                <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>took pictures of both</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/kySX6Dx.jpg"/>

                                                 from

                                                  and tried to see if I could rebuild them from only those pictures. (I think I only partly succeeded.) Later in October, Grampa, my mom, and some of the other kids got to meet this artist lady, and she came over one day and

                                                  <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>gave us a little art lesson</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OCFWqoc.jpg"/>

                                                   I think at the same event, they all got to do

                                                   <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>drawing lessons</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/yEiX4ig.jpg"/>

                                                    with a guy named Mark Kistler because Grampa had connections.

                                                   (I think I remember her specifically teaching us how to use those paper roll things that blur pencil lines.) The next day, we went to the Altics' house

                                                   <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>for dinner</u>!</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/jbAEDHq.jpg"/>

                                                    I remember talking about what Mr. Jerell did for a job with my dad/parents (working at the church nearby). When we got there, we were given some Lego sets. Kesed got one from the Lego Movie and I got a car that also turned into a T-Rex and a seaplane. That set was AWESOME. I remember after getting it my parents and I joked about how that was the last time they would see me for the day/week, which was pretty much accurate, as I spent hours upon hours building my Lego set in the playroom. I'm not sure if I did it in this case, but oftentimes I would build Kesed's Lego sets for him and he would play with them. He always enjoyed the playing part while I enjoyed the building part more. Later that month, my dad got ordained as a preacher. I thought he had already been ordained for a while, but apparently not, according to my mom. On the 27th, there was a baby shower for one of our relatives. Us guys went up to the movie room and watched a movie. (That made me look forward to the baby shower, for that reason.) The next day, the Hulseman's came over, and we got to see Mrs. Laura (formerly Laura Wilkinson), an olympic gold medalist diver. We actually got to

                                                    <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>see, hold</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OnLiJWs.jpg"/>

                                                     and

                                                     <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>take pictures with</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vIV3CeT.jpg"/>

                                                     her gold medal! So that was just AWESOME. That night, I remember playing with the detached blades of a boomerang helicopter toy I had gotten recently. I had studied the instruction nonstop trying to figure out how to make it come back to me, but I just couldn't get it to work. That's what I was doing in the backyard when I got called over real quick as they were about to leave for

                                                     <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a group picture</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OIuLFce.jpg"/>

                                                     I do remember looking at their (I think) youngest (adopted) daughter and trying to figure out what was wrong with her mouth. (It slanted to the sides a bit.)

                                                     Anyways, on the 31st, we all drove out to

                                                     <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>College Station</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/dI2lP4T.jpg"/>

                                                      to visit A&M!

                                                     <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>We ate Freebirds</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/RCxsr4L.jpg"/>

                                                      with some random people I didn't know, and though I wanted to order a Monster size, but my parents wouldn't let me. (Freebirds was/is also the place where they hang up people's tin foil sculptures, so that was fun to do with Charis and Kesed while we waited for the adults to finish talking so we could leave.) Then we actually went around campus. We saw this

                                                      <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>domed building</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/vaUAcaV.jpg"/>

                                                       where apprently they painted green so plane pilots flying over stopped getting blinded by the reflection of the sunlight. We also saw

                                                       <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this old giant tree</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/OsKU8qm.jpg"/>

                                                        that apparently had a lot of history. We also once again visited

                                                        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the church where my parents met</u>!</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lt0yeCX.jpg"/>

                                                        We then had dinner with some

                                                        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>friends of our parents, the Stuarts</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0hqAtJv.jpg"/>

                                                         that lived nearby. They had two young daughters, the older of which (far end) liked Frozen, had glasses, and was sorta a brat. The next day we watched the movie Frozen there and did that older girl's birthday party, where we threw artificially brought snowballs at a

                                                         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>a giant paper poster of Marshmallow</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/eA5PWCI.jpg"/>

                                                         And with that, we move into November 2014!

                                                         That same November 1st, we went and had dinner with

                                                         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>this other family</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/egfJoqa.jpg"/>

                                                          that had a bajillion (aka I think 7) kids, some biological and some adopted. We

                                                         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>carved pumpkins</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/8nQFiJA.jpg"/>

                                                          with them, which was a first. Some of us also helped them pick sweet potatoes from the garden in their backyard. During dinner, where we had soup of some kind, I remember us kids realizing that we outnumbered the adults 3:1, and joking with the idea of some sort of possible coup. The adults laughed at that, then said to each other how it would stop quickly once we realized who controlled the credit cards and other adult things. So that was that. Their oldest girl was older than Selah's age, but I remember thinking she was pretty. But yeah. With that, we went back to the Woodlands to Mimi and Grampa's house!

                                                          This was the stateside where I did the most lizard-catching. Mimi and Grampa had a ton of

<span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>green</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/Vwrirm8.jpg"/>

 and

 <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>brown anoles</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/0QO4vKh.jpg"/>

  in their backyard, and I would go out for hours slowly sneaking up on them and snatching at them with my hands. I got really good at catching them. By the time we flew back to China, I must have caught upwards of 40 lizards. Grampa got this tank thing that had trees and rocks and stuff for the lizards to live in. We went to Petsmart and got crickets and dried mealworms to feed them with. (I used a spray bottle to give them water) It was kinda sad/gross though - by the end of the stateside, when we were letting all the lizards go, there were some that were all the way up the hollow trunk of the plastic tree, I think dead/stuck and about to die.

  Speaking of reptiles, there was another incident of note that happened this stateside. I was outside (I think hunting for lizards), and Makaria comes over and tells me there's a snake on the other side of the back floor area in the other bush/flower beds. I got up immediately and went over to see what she was talking about, and there it was: a small red, yellow, and black striped snake. I immediately told Makaria to get back. I wasn't sure which species of snake it was yet, though, so I looked closely and remembered the rhyme, "Red touches black, venom lack. Red touches yellow, kills a fellow." This was from a giant reptiles book I had gotten at some point and read nonstop for the past few months. Well, sure enough, red was touching yellow, which meant it was a lethally venomous

  <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>coral snake</u>.</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/H5AnhIK.jpg"/>

  I told Makaria to run back inside and tell our dad and Grampa. Grampa went and got his spear tool thing specifically designed for things like this and gave it to my dad. My dad slowly went up to it while us kids watched him from a little ways back. He then stabbed it through right behind the head, and once its movement had slowed he took its head off. So... yeah. The blood stayed in faded spots on those steps for a little bit, and the snake came up whenever we saw it. So yeah. I wasn't really happy that we were killing it, since humans kill way too many snakes each year, but because of the young kids and the dog, it was apparently just the safer thing to do.

  Aaaanyways, around this time Selah started a fundraiser for some trip/event she wanted to do. She sold

  <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>hand-drawn fridge magnets</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/7ZyDgM8.jpg"/>

   made from paper and metal bottle caps to relatives and random people alike. She spent a ton of time on those, and it was one of those maturing moments where I saw her as doing grown-up sorta things. I did help her once with cutting out the paper circles, but most of the work was entirely by her, with my mom helping her through the brainstorming/marketing process.

   On the 7th, my parents took us to this trailer park charity awareness thing. Basically, you went into these big metal things and went through various

   <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>display rooms</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/TMH9zV7.jpg"/>

    while wearing headphones and listening to audio of people who would live in places similar to those shown in the displays. I had one of those time-memory-realization moments, and I remember looking at the shiny metal outside as well as the bright sun in the sky.

    The next day, my mom went on a

    <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>camping trip</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/J7R3CGb.jpg"/>

     with a couple other women, inluding Lydia and maybe Kayla from Fuzhou.

     Also on the 9th, my mom and Selah went and did

      together for Selah's 13th birthday celebrations. The 13th is special in our family. Dad does the boys and mom does the girls, and whichever parent and kid it is go on a day where they do a bunch of fun stuff, eat food, play games, spend the night at a hotel, the works. Whatever is most fun. This is a time to talk over the process of growing up and maturing as well. They also give the kid a ring/other accessory to serve as a reminder of my parents' and God's love for them. So yeah! That was

      One of the things we did this stateside was go on

      <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>bike rides</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/37RMe44.jpg"/>

       with Mimi and (sometimes) Grampa. They got a whole bunch of bikes for us and the McKowns to use when we came over, and they were

       <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>NICE</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Oc1R6C.jpg"/>

        bikes. Grampa had a sit/lay down trike that we weren't allowed to touch. Whenever we all went out, we usually went either to the park outside of Tranquil Path to the left or towards the lake down to the right. I would always aim for acorns in the road, because when you drove over them they would make a cracking popping noise, which was fun. I always loved going REALLY fast and getting ahead of everyone else. Then I would have to either wait for everyone else or loop back around and meet up with them again. On the final stretch back to the house down Tranquil Path, me and Charis would usually race to the end. (I think I usually won.)

        So yeah. In that last picture, you can see the next thing that happened, Kayla and Amanda's visit! It was so much fun getting to see them again. We hung out at

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the pool/spa</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/tnNS4dL.jpg"/>

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>the park</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/EgiIIwg.jpg"/>

        and

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>Cold Stone ice cream</u>!</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/p3Ny6Z7.jpg"/>

        That was where my mom really introduced me to mint chocolate chip ice cream, which I LOVED. It was also maybe the first place I tried putting gummies as a topping on ice cream and realizing the issues that came with that. I also remember questioning the purpose of a cone, saying you got less ice cream that way than if you just filled up a bowl or a cup. Oh, we also went to a

        <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>trampoline park</u>,</span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/533h3Ow.jpg"/>

         which was super fun.

         Oh, and speaking of trampoline parks, there's another aspect of this stateside that I should mention. We had a couple games going with Grampa whenever we were in the car. One of them was where we would try to find numbers in order ONLY when we were in the car. That meant license plates, advertisements, phone numbers, etc. Any numbers found had to be verified by another person so no one faked finding one. I rember finding a number in the 60s at a place in the middle of nowhere on the serial number on a tag on the side of one of the big trucks that were parked there. (Around the same time Grampa took us to have real Texan barbecue (which when we were little we called Barbie-Q, like the girls' toy), which all of us were so-so on.) We did this game every time we went out in Grampa's car, whether on errands or fun trips, like one of the other times we went to a trampoline park, hence the connection. (That time I just remember it being in sort of an empty area on the side of the highway and Happy by Pharrell Williams playing in the background.) We tried to get to 100, and we actually DID, on a billboard on the way to the airport when we left to go back to China. So that was super lucky. The other game that I think was on this same stateside was the BOI-OI-OI-OI-OINGGGG game. This was where whenever you were caught saying 'um', 'uh', or some variation of the sort, everyone would yell BOI-OI-OI-OI-OINGGGG, and whoever had the most of those by the end of the car ride lost, and might have had a punishment of some sort. The younger kids ended up resorting to just not talking much, which was exactly what us older kids tried to get them to do MORE of, since they weren't as good at the game. Around this time, Grampa and my dad took us to go watch Big Hero 6 in the theaters, and we played this game along the way. I had had several close calls (soon before this I had been boingggged and had gotten frustrated because I felt it was a controversial call, calling my 'ahhh' part of another word or something like that, and since it had been right at the end of the car ride to see I think Flipper 2 in theaters.) Anyway, as we pulled closer to the theater, I said "I'm gonna wait till the end of the game then just run out and committ suicide", meaning I would say um and uh a ton to finally get some relief. I guess I shouldn't have used that phrase so flippantly, though, because both Grampa and my dad freaked out and my dad sorta reached out to me. I was really confused at first, then my dad had to explain not to use that sort of phrasing. So yeah. I did love Big Hero 6. It became my favorite movie right as I watched it, which is something not a lot of movies do. I remember walking out into the glaring sunlight and thinking through the entire movie and just loving it.

         But yeah. Back in the main timeline in late November, I remember going out on a hike thing in the woods around Mimi and Grampa's house. Grampa cut out some

         <span onmouseover="scroll123();" onmouseout="scroll123();"><u>staffs for me and Charis</u></span> <img class="picture" src="https://i.imgur.com/83QBqI9.jpg"/>

          to use as walking sticks with this super sharp outdoors knife saw thing, so that was pretty cool. And that was November 2014!
