My first memory is getting Pablo. Heâ€™s a stuffed penguin from the TV show the Backyardigans, which I loved as a kid. I was 2 years old at this point, and we were in America for a short period of time (but we were living in Qinhuangdao). Apparently, my mom and dad had left my last stuffed animal (a gorilla) behind. We were on some long car ride at the time, and when my parents realized they panicked and quickly drove to a nearby store to get another one. I remember choosing between him and a Curious George stuffed animal, and that I chose Pablo because he had more soft parts, as opposed to stiff velvety parts. Pablo has always held temperatures and smells really well, and I've slept with him as long as I can remember. I still do. When I was in Fuzhou, I tried to get out of punishments with him<p>
